<h2><a name="PREFACE" id="PREFACE">PREFACE</a></h2>

<p class="drop-cap2"><span class="smcap">It</span> might have been expected that the attempt to trace to their
origin in the past the institutions and customs in common use
upon the sea would from an early date occupy the attention of a
seafaring people, but for some obscure reason the British nation has
always been indifferent to the history of its activities upon that element
on which its greatness was founded, and to which it has become more
and more dependent for its daily bread and its very existence. To
those who are alive to this fact it will hardly come as a surprise, therefore,
to learn that the first sustained attempt at a detailed investigation
into the history of the flag at sea was made under the patronage of
the German Admiralty by a German Admiral. Vice-Admiral Siegel's
<cite>Die Flagge</cite>, published in 1912, was the first book to deal with the
development of the flag at sea in a scientific spirit, and although the
earlier chapters contain some mistakes due to his employment of
translations of early works instead of original texts, and the accounts
of the British flags in the later chapters suffer because he had no
access to original records, it is a worthy piece of work.</p>

<p>The present book is an attempt to remove the reproach to the
British nation which this implies. Its plan is somewhat different from
that of the work referred to above. Instead of dealing with the flags
of all maritime nations of the world&mdash;a task that (if it was to be more
than a mere copying or compilation) would entail much work in
foreign archives&mdash;it seemed more profitable to concentrate upon the
history of British Naval Flags, for researches made so far back as
1908 had taught me how much that is inaccurate about their history
had received acceptance. But first it seemed necessary to devote some
time and space to the inquiry into the origin of the flag and how it
became the honoured symbol of nationality that it now is, and for
this a general view had to be taken in order that a firm foundation
might be laid for the early history of our own flags.</p>

<p>In the first chapter the ground worked over by Admiral Siegel
has been solidified by examination of the original authorities, with
the result that a few errors have been detected and some new facts
brought to light, and the investigation has also been extended further;
the most important of the additions being those relating to the
standards in the Phoenician and Greek ships of war, forms of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">[vi]</a></span>
early "standard" and "gonfanon," and the Genoese Standard of
St George and the Dragon. For the deduction that the use of a national
flag arose in the Italian city states I take the entire responsibility,
well aware that further investigations may possibly bring to light
fresh facts which will overthrow it.</p>

<p>The chapter on early English, Scottish and Irish flags serves as
an introduction to the history of our national flag, which was invented
for the use of the mercantile marine, though it was very soon appropriated
by the Royal Navy for its sole use. It is very improbable
that further research will enable the gap left by the unfortunate
destruction of the early 17th century records to be filled, so that the
story of the Union Flag may be taken as being substantially complete,
but there is still room for further work upon the history of its component
crosses. It will be seen that I have been unable to find any
solid ground for the common belief that the cross of St George was
introduced as the national emblem of England by Richard I, and am
of opinion that it did not begin to attain that position until the first
years of the reign of Edward I.</p>

<p>The chapters on the flags used to indicate distinctions of command
and service at sea give an account of the use (now obsolete) of the
Royal Standard at sea by naval commanders-in-chief; of the history
of the Admiralty anchor-flag; and of the steps by which the present
Admirals' flags were evolved. The history of the ensigns from their
first adoption at sea about the end of Elizabeth's reign has been set
out in some detail, but further research may bring to light more
details of interest in the years between 1574 and 1653. The causes
which led to the adoption of a red ensign as the most important
British ensign and the steps which led to its appropriation to the
Mercantile Marine, and not the Royal Navy, are stated as far as the
records availed, though here again further research is needed in the
late Elizabethan and early Stuart periods among records that may
still survive in private ownership. These chapters may, perhaps,
appeal rather to the seaman and the student of naval history than
to the general reader, but it is hoped that they may also prove of
service to artists who wish to avoid the anachronisms into which
some of their brethren have been betrayed.</p>

<p>In order that the development of flag signals may be properly
appreciated it has been necessary, when dealing with the earlier years,
to take into account what had happened outside the narrow circuit
of British waters. The earlier matter, though here examined solely
from the point of view of the flags used, offers considerable interest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vii" id="Page_vii">[vii]</a></span>
to the student of naval tactics, with which indeed the art of signalling
is inseparably connected.</p>

<p>The last chapter, on Ceremonial and other usages, is, from the
author's point of view, the least satisfactory. From the nature of the
subject, the official records contain very little information about it.
It is only by the slow and laborious process of examining contemporary
journals, diaries, accounts of voyages, and similar material
that facts can be found for any exhaustive treatment of these matters.
Something of this has been done, but more remains to do.</p>

<p>In concluding the work which has occupied a large portion of
the leisure hours of many years, it is my pleasant duty to express my
gratitude to the numerous friends whose encouragement and assistance
have enabled me to persevere in what has proved a somewhat arduous
task; especially to Sir Julian Corbett, who has read the proofs and
given me the benefit of his criticisms; to the officials of the Pepysian
Library, Public Record Office, British Museum and London Library
for the facilities afforded me; and not least to my friend Mr Vaughan
who has spared no pains in the preparation of the coloured plates.</p>

<h2><a name="Chapter_I" id="Chapter_I"></a><a href="#CONTENTS">Chapter I</a></h2>

<h3><i>The Origin of the Flag and its Development up to the
end of the Thirteenth Century</i></h3>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">A flag</span> may be defined as a piece of pliable material, attached at
one end so as to move freely in the wind, serving as a sign or a
decoration. This word is now common to the nations of north-western
Europe<a name="FNanchor_1" id="FNanchor_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>, but it does not appear to have come into use in
this particular meaning until the sixteenth century, and the etymology
of it is obscure. Perhaps the most satisfactory of the derivations
hitherto put forward is that of Professor Skeat, who derives it
from the Middle English "flakken" to fly, one of a number of similar
onomatopoeic words suggestive of the sound of something flapping
in the wind. Its first appearance with a meaning coming within the
above definition is as a specific term denoting a rectangular piece of
material attached by one vertical edge, flown at the masthead of a
ship, as a symbol of nationality or leadership. It was not until towards
the end of the seventeenth century that the word began to take on
the more general meaning it now has, and indeed the restricted meaning
still partially survives in the German language, in which the word
"Flagge" is properly applicable only to flags flown at sea, those on
land being called "Fahnen." Before the seventeenth century there
was no generic term in the English language that covered the various
forms&mdash;banners, ensigns, streamers, pendants, etc.&mdash;that are now
generally included under the term "flag."</p>

<p>A somewhat similar change in meaning has, during the course of
centuries, affected nearly every flag name, and constitutes one of the
great difficulties in the way of a clear exposition of the early history
of flags. Moreover, the early writers are neither consistent in their
use of terms nor accurate in their application. This renders the correct
interpretation of many passages a matter requiring caution and
discrimination and, it may be added, experience. As a guide to the
reader we shall set down the principal terms to be met with, and
indicate the extent to which their meaning has changed, but before
doing so it is desirable to explain one or two technical or semi-technical
terms employed in connection with the parts of a flag. The
part next the staff or line to which it is attached is called the "hoist"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
by seamen, or heraldically the head or "chief"; the remainder of the
flag is the "fly." The fly may be forked or swallow-tailed. If the end
of the fly is divided by a simple incision which does not remove
material, it is said to be "slit." The fly may be produced into a
number of pointed or round-ended tails, to which the Crusaders
gave the name of tongues (<em>linguae</em>, <em>lingulae</em>). The British and many
other ensigns have in the upper part next the staff a rectangular compartment
containing a national device. In modern flags this usually
occupies one-fourth of the flag, but in early flags it was much
smaller. This is called a "canton." The other terms that need
explanation at this stage are as follows:</p>

<p><span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc" title="Sêmeion">Σημεῖον</span> (Semeion). This word appears to have been first used in
the abstract meaning of "sign" or "signal"; to have been then applied
to the object by which the signal was made, or which signalised
the presence of the commanding officer. In the early period of Greece
this was not a flag, but a staff-like object.</p>

<p><b>Insigne</b>, pl. <b>Insignia</b>. The Latin equivalent of the above, denoting
a sign, signal, or staff of office.</p>

<p><b>Signum.</b> A token or sign, especially the distinctive sign of a division
of the Roman army. Also used to denote "signal" in the abstract.</p>

<p><b>Vexillum.</b> A square flag hung from a transverse bar at the head
of a staff; the principal form of flag in use in the classical period.
In late writers this word is used to cover any form of flag, and from
the eighth century onwards will be found applied as well to objects
that were not flags, for which the word <em>insigne</em> should have been used.</p>

<p><b>Banner</b> (late Latin <em>bandum</em>, <em>bannum</em>). A rectangular flag attached
laterally to its staff. Originally of much greater depth than length,
a "band" of coloured material attached to a lance by one of its longer
sides, it gradually became square. The banner was primarily the
personal flag of an emperor, king, lord or knight, and served to mark
his presence in the army or fleet, and as a rallying point for his retainers.
On the introduction of heraldic devices these were inserted
upon it. It was also employed by religious or civic bodies for a similar
purpose. In modern language this term is usually applied to flags
hung from transverse bars, displayed in religious or political processions,
but we shall not employ it in this meaning.</p>

<div class="caption">PLATE I &mdash; Early Flags</div>
</div>

<p><b>Gonfanon</b>, <b>Gonfalon</b>. This word appears in the <cite>Anglo-Saxon
Chronicle</cite> as <em>guðfana</em>, and in the <cite>Chanson de Roland</cite> as <em>gunfanun</em>. It
is apparently derived from the Norse <em>gunn-fane</em> (war-flag) and in its
earlier forms was probably of the shape shown on the Northumbrian
coins about 925 <span class="smcap">a.d.</span><a name="FNanchor_2" id="FNanchor_2"></a>
    <a href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> Among the Normans two centuries later it had
a square body and ended in three or more long tails, a form handed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
on to the Italian Communes. Some writers apply this name (inaccurately)
to flags of vexillum form, with or without tails at the base.</p>

<p><b>Standard.</b> This word presents great difficulty, and it has undergone
a radical change in meaning which (so far as I am aware) has
never been explained. As no historical survey of the development
of the flag can fairly ignore the need for such an explanation it will
be necessary to treat it at some length. At different periods in history
since the eleventh century the word under one or more of its many
forms (e.g. estandart, standart, standardum, standarz, standarum,
standalem), has had the following meanings:</p>

<p>(i) A tall pole or staff supporting some object that was not a flag.</p>

<p>(ii) A tall pole or mast set in a four-wheeled chariot, supporting
various objects, including one or more flags.</p>

<p>(iii) An elongated tapering flag containing the arms or badges of
a king or noble.</p>

<p>(iv) A rectangular banner containing the royal arms.</p>

<p>One of the earliest appearances of the word is in the <cite>Chanson de
Roland</cite>. The oldest existing <span class="smcap">ms.</span> of this poem was, it is true, not
written before the latter part of the twelfth century, but it is well
known that the poem itself is much older. In this long poem of some
4000 lines the word occurs thrice only, and is confined to the episode
which relates to Baligant, Emir of Babylon, which M. Gaston Paris
considers to be the work of another author. The passages in question
are:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza" lang="fro" xml:lang="fro">
<span class="i0">3265. &nbsp; Li amiralz mult par est riches hum<br /></span>
<span class="i6">Dedavant lui fait porter sun dragun<br /></span>
<span class="i6">E l'estandart Tervagan e Mahum.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i6">[The Emir is a very great man<br /></span>
<span class="i6">Before him he has carried his dragon<br /></span>
<span class="i6">And the standard of Tervagan and Mahomet.]<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza" lang="fro" xml:lang="fro">
<span class="i0">3329. &nbsp; Carles li magnes, cum il vit l'amiraill<br /></span>
<span class="i6">E le dragun, l'enseigne, e l'estandart,<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i6">[Charlemagne, when he saw the emir<br /></span>
<span class="i6">And the dragon, the flag and the standard,]<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza" lang="fro" xml:lang="fro">
<span class="i0">3551. &nbsp; Baliganz veit sun gunfanun cadeir<br /></span>
<span class="i6">E l'estandart Mahumet remaneir.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i6">[Baligant sees his gonfanon fall<br /></span>
<span class="i6">And the standard of Mahomet remain (defenceless).]<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>In speaking of the flags the poet (or perhaps poets) uses either the
words "enseigne" or "gunfanun" or, in one instance, "orie flambe."
What then was the "Standard of Mahomet" which the author of
this section has in mind? The story he is telling is, of course, purely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
mythical, so that he, or the original inventor of the myth, must have
met the word and the object which it connoted in some other connection.
The most likely source of this knowledge is the First Crusade.
During the struggle for the possession of Jerusalem in the summer
of 1099, Robert of Normandy, in personal combat, seized from one of
the Saracen Emirs an object which is described as a very long pole
covered over with silver, having at its top a golden ball or apple
(<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">pomum aureum</i>). This was called a standard, a word which was
evidently at that time of recent introduction, for the contemporary
historians, some of whom had been eye-witnesses of the events they
relate, have various ways of spelling it, and usually refer to it in such
a way as to indicate that the word was not in familiar use<a name="FNanchor_3" id="FNanchor_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a>. According
to Albert of Aix<a name="FNanchor_4" id="FNanchor_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> this standard was borne in front of the army of the
"King of Babylon" and was the centre around which the flower of
the army gathered and to which stragglers returned. A few years
later Fulcher of Chartres notes the capture of three more "standards,"
but does not describe them.</p>

<p>The second form of standard (which was apparently imitated
from the Italian <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">carrocio</i> presently to be described) makes its appearance
nearly a hundred years later. In an engagement with the
Saracens near Acre at the end of August, 1191, the banner of Richard I
was borne aloft on a machine of which the unknown but contemporary
author of the <cite>Itinerarium Regis Ricardi</cite> gives the following description:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The Normans formed a rampart around the Standard, which in order
that it may be better known we have not thought it out of the way to
describe. It consists, then, of a very long beam, like the mast of a ship,
placed upon four wheels in a frame very solidly fastened together and
bound with iron, so that it seems incapable of yielding either to sword,
axe or fire. Affixed to the very top of this, the royal flag, commonly called
banner, flies in the wind. For the protection of this machine, especially
in battle in the open, a selected band of soldiers is appointed, so that it
may not be broken down by onrush of the enemy or overthrown by any
injury, for if by any chance it should be overthrown the army would be
dispersed and confounded, because it would not know in what part of the
field to rally. Moreover, the hearts of the soldiers would be filled with the
fear that their leader had been overcome if they did not see his banner
borne aloft. Nor would they in the rear readily come forward to resist the
enemy if, from the withdrawal of his banner, they feared that some ill
fortune had happened to their king. But while that standard remained
erect the people had a sure place of refuge. Hither the sick were brought
to be cured, hither were brought the wounded, and even famous or illustrious
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>men tired out in the fighting. Whence, because it stands fast as a
sign to all the people, it is called the "Standard."<a name="FNanchor_5" id="FNanchor_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> It is placed upon four
wheels, not without reason, in order that, according to the state of the
battle, it may be either brought forward as the enemy yield or drawn back
as they press on.</p></div>

<p>It is to a machine similar to this, and bearing aloft a pyx and
three banners, that the battle near Northallerton in 1138 owes its
name of Battle of the Standard.</p>

<p>The use of this form of standard was not confined to the English;
indeed it seems to have been in general use in the armies of western
Europe in the twelfth and thirteenth centuries, and the transference
of the name from the support to the royal, ducal, or state flag that it
bore was a natural consequence. This transference evidently began
to take place about the end of the thirteenth century, for in 1282 the
State gonfanon of Genoa, hitherto called the "vexillum" of St George,
in the <cite>Annales Genoenses</cite>, becomes the "Stantarium B. Georgii." In
England the change seems to have taken place a little later. I have not
met with it before the year 1323, when the Exchequer Accounts contain
references to Standards (Estandartz, estandardes) bearing the
royal arms and made of worsted of Aylesham.</p>

<p>But the name was not given in England to every form of flag
bearing the royal arms or cross of St George. It was confined to a
particular type intermediate in length between the streamer and the
banner<a name="FNanchor_6" id="FNanchor_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a>. This type was evidently the direct descendant of the "gonfanon,"
which is the only form of flag represented on such of the great
seals of our early kings as show flags at all<a name="FNanchor_7" id="FNanchor_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a>. From the fact that it is
this form which is depicted at the masthead of the ships in early
seals, as for instance those of Hastings and Lyme Regis (thirteenth
century) and of Dover (1305) reproduced in <a href="#PLATE_III">Plate III</a>, we may infer
that it was the type most convenient for use at the head of the
"standard," and therefore the type to which the name gradually
became applied. During the fourteenth century the tails were reduced
in number to two and the flag made to taper gradually throughout
its length. Finally, the heralds established a form in which the
tails were short, blunt and rounded off at the end, which they decided
should contain the cross of St George in chief with the motto and
badges of the owner, but not his arms, in the fly. This change seems
to have taken place about the end of the fifteenth century. By the
restriction of the royal arms to flags of banner form the name
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>"standard," when qualified by the adjective "royal" (but only in
this connection), became transferred to the royal banner of arms,
not only in popular speech which makes no account of such technical
niceties, but also in official usage from Tudor times to this day.</p>

<p><b>Streamer.</b> A long and relatively narrow flag flown at sea from the
masthead, top or yardarm, often reaching down to the water. The
earlier name of the modern "pendant." The term is also applied to
any ribbon-like flag or decoration.</p>

<p><b>Pennon.</b> Originally a small pointed flag worn at the lance-head
by knights; but the word was used at sea in the fourteenth and
fifteenth centuries to denote a short streamer.</p>

<p><b>Pennoncel.</b> A small pennon.</p>

<p><b>Pennant</b> (in modern official language written "pendant," but
pronounced "pennant"). A synonym for "streamer," a name which
it has gradually replaced.</p>

<p><b>Geton</b>, <b>gytton</b>, <b>guidon</b>. A small swallow-tailed flag.</p>

<p><b>Ensign</b> (corruptly written "ancient" during the sixteenth to
eighteenth centuries). This word was borrowed from the land service
in the sixteenth century to denote the striped flag then introduced on
the poop of ships. In explaining the meaning of this word in the
Army, Barret<a name="FNanchor_8" id="FNanchor_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> remarks: "We Englishmen do call them (Ensigns)
of late Colours, by reason of the variety of colours they be made of,
whereby they be the better noted and known to the companie."</p>

<p><b>Colours.</b> Originally applied to an ensign; afterwards extended to
mean the flags commonly flown by a ship. At the end of the seventeenth
century a "suit of colours" included ensign, jack and pendant.</p>

<p><b>Jack.</b> A small flag flown on the bowsprit.</p>

<p>Upon the water, as upon the land, the Standard (taking the word
in its earliest meaning) seems to have preceded the Flag by many
centuries. The earliest knowledge we have of its existence is derived
from the pottery of the pre-dynastic Egyptians, to whom, on the most
moderate estimate of Egyptologists, a date not later than 4000 <span class="smcap">b.c.</span>
has been assigned. Among the primitive decorations of the earthenware
vases and boxes of that period the representation of a boat<a name="FNanchor_9" id="FNanchor_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a>
frequently appears. In these boats, which seem to have been in use
only on the Nile, the two cabins amidships are a prominent feature.
At the end of the aftermost cabin rises a tall pole with an emblem at
the top, which is believed to represent the district or town to which
the owner of the boat belonged. There are at least eighteen different
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>forms of this emblem<a name="FNanchor_10" id="FNanchor_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a>, but these standards all agree in having in
their upper part two pendent objects which appear to be long ribbons
or streamers attached to the pole. These standards were developed
into the nome-standards of the Egyptian armies, but they never again
appear in Egypt in connection with boats, which from the time of the
First Dynasty onwards are invariably represented without standard
or flag of any kind, although in rare instances the top of the steering

<p>Standards appear to have been in use at a later date among all the
Semitic nations, but evidence of their use upon the sea before the
fifth century <span class="smcap">b.c.</span> is not forthcoming. From about the end of that
century onwards Sidon and Aradus (Arvad), the two great seaports
of Phoenicia, referred to by the prophet Ezekiel in his lamentation
for Tyre<a name="FNanchor_11" id="FNanchor_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> as supplying the mariners for that city, placed upon their
coinage<a name="FNanchor_12" id="FNanchor_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> a representation of a war galley. At the stern of this galley,
supported against a curved ornament similar to that to which the
Greeks gave the name "Aphlaston," is placed a tall staff having at
its top a globe within the arms of a crescent, representing the sun and
moon. In the earlier examples this is too indistinct for successful
photographic representation but it is clearly visible in the coins of
the fourth century shown in <a href="#PLATE_II">Plate II</a><a name="FNanchor_13" id="FNanchor_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a>.</p>

<p>After the submission of those cities to Alexander the Great in
333 <span class="smcap">b.c.</span> the globe and crescent seems to have been exchanged for a
cruciform standard similar to that shown in the left hand of the
goddess Astarte in the coin of 87 <span class="smcap">b.c.</span> depicted in <a href="#PLATE_II">Plate II</a>, fig. 4.
This cruciform standard was probably adopted by Alexander from
the Athenians, the most prominent naval power of Greece, among
whom it seems to have been an object of great significance<a name="FNanchor_14" id="FNanchor_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a>. On two
great amphorae awarded to the victors in the Panathenaic games of
336-5 <span class="smcap">b.c.</span>, now in the British Museum, it is represented in a manner
which can leave no doubt as to its symbolic importance. On one of
them Athene holds in her hand a long cruciform staff, the head of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>which is expanded in ovoid form. On the other amphora the goddess
has by her side a short column which is surmounted by a winged
Victory (Nike) holding in her left hand a similar standard, and in her
right the aphlaston of a galley. Unfortunately for our purpose, the
Athenians did not represent ships upon their coinage, but similar
standards are seen in the hand of the nymph Histiaea upon the coins
of the Euboean town of that name, dated circa 313-265 <span class="smcap">b.c.</span>, two of
which are represented in <a href="#PLATE_II">Plate II</a>, figs. 7 and 8. Many other instances,
too numerous to detail, will be found upon later Greek coins. In
these the crosses are not all of the same design, and Prof. Babelon
has collected examples of thirty-six forms, all more or less different,
from the plain cross to a more elaborate form in which the head terminates
in a ball and two small winged figures of Victory kneel at the
ends of the arms. Some of these forms are decorated with narrow
streamers; in many of them the cross-piece is not at right angles to
the staff, but it is possible that this may be due to an attempt at
perspective. One other instance deserves mention: the excavations
on the site of the important city of Pergamum in Asia Minor, once the
capital of the kingdom of Pergamus, and afterwards that of the
Roman province of Asia, have brought to light the bas-reliefs which
decorated the balustrade of the Portico of Athene Polias. On this
bas-relief, which, in the opinion of M. Collignon<a name="FNanchor_15" id="FNanchor_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a>, alludes to naval
victories under Attalus (241-197 <span class="smcap">b.c.</span>) or Eumenes II (197-159), the
cruciform standard is twice represented in highly ornate forms terminating
in pine cones at the head; in each case it is accompanied
with the aphlasta and beaks of galleys.</p>

<p>A careful study of all the examples leads to the conclusion that
this globe and crescent, or cruciform, standard was the symbol of
naval authority, the prototype in fact of the Admiral's flag. The
name of this standard is not specifically stated, but there can be no
doubt that it is the <em>semeion</em> (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc" title="sêmeion">σημεῖον</span>) frequently referred to by
Greek authors in describing naval actions. That the <em>semeion</em> was a
solid object we know from the fact that it was raised aloft in giving
signals<a name="FNanchor_16" id="FNanchor_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a>. There is evidence that <em>semeia</em> were of various forms and
that these forms were distinctive of the nationality of the ship. Of
Artemisia, queen of Halicarnassus, who accompanied Xerxes in his
expedition against Greece and fought on the Persian side at the
Battle of Salamis (480 <span class="smcap">b.c.</span>), Polyaenus, in his <cite>Strategemata</cite>, relates
that she had two <em>semeia</em>, one of "barbarian" form, the other Greek.
When she was pursuing a Greek ship she raised aloft the barbarian
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>standard<a name="FNanchor_17" id="FNanchor_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a>, but when fleeing before a Greek ship she raised the Greek
standard, so that her pursuer took her ship for Greek and kept off
from it. The "barbarian" standard used by Artemisia was probably
the globe and crescent above referred to, for Sidon supplied Xerxes
with the best of his ships, and it was in Sidonian ships that Xerxes
himself was wont to embark<a name="FNanchor_18" id="FNanchor_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a>. It seems, on the other hand, probable
that a cruciform standard was in common use by all the Greek states
at an early period, for Polyaenus relates that Chabrias, the Athenian
general, just before his action off Naxos in 376 with the Lacedaemonian
fleet under Pollis, ordered his subordinate commanders to remove
the <em>semeia</em> from their ships and to keep in mind, in the ensuing
conflict, that all ships bearing such signs were enemies<a name="FNanchor_19" id="FNanchor_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a>.</p>

<p>The flag was evidently unknown to the early Greeks; it is never
mentioned by Homer, and indeed there is no equivalent word in the
language of the classical period, yet at the time when we first meet with
the standard on the Phoenician coins flags were in common use by
the Chinese. The Chinese classics on the art of war known as the
Sun Tzu and Wu Tzu, written in the fifth century <span class="smcap">b.c.</span>, make frequent
reference to them. They played a very important part in marshalling
the army and inspiriting the soldiers, and the correct
moment to strike the enemy was judged by the disorder of their
flags. According to Wu, the Chinese flags contained various animal
emblems.</p>

<p>The origin of the flag in European waters may however be dated
from the end of the fifth century <span class="smcap">b.c.</span>, when a primitive form was, if
later writers<a name="FNanchor_20" id="FNanchor_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> are a safe guide, in use in the Athenian navy. This was
the "purple garment" or "Phoinikis<a name="FNanchor_21" id="FNanchor_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a>," used as a signal for combat
or as the sign of the Admiral's ship. Possibly the use of this emblem
may have been imitated from the Phoenicians. It may, on the other
hand, have originated independently, from a necessity of rendering
the cruciform standard more conspicuous in action. There is not
sufficient evidence to decide this point, but it is significant that the
<em>vexillum</em> in use among the Romans at a somewhat later date shows
traces of a similar origin.</p>

<p>The military standard or <em>signum</em> of the Romans consisted of a lance
with silver-plated shaft with a cross-piece at the top, from which in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>some instances a small vexillum was suspended. From the ends of
this cross-piece, whether it held a vexillum or not, hung ribbons with
silver ivy leaves at the ends. Below were a number of discs, which are
believed to represent the honours conferred upon the Legion to
which the <em>signum</em> belonged<a name="FNanchor_22" id="FNanchor_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a>. Below these again was a crescent, as a
charm against ill-fortune. In the <em>signa</em> of the Praetorian guard the
discs were replaced by crowns alternating with medallion portraits
of the imperial house. These <em>signa</em> were used as company ensigns to
facilitate the tactical movements of the Legion. The principal standard
of the Legion, answering to the Regimental Colours, was the <em>aquila</em>
or eagle. Pliny the Elder<a name="FNanchor_23" id="FNanchor_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> informs us that</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Caius Marius in his second consulship (<span class="smcap">b.c.</span> 103) assigned the eagle
exclusively to the Roman Legions. Before that period it had only held the
first rank, there being four others as well, the wolf, the minotaur, the horse
and the wild boar, each of which preceded a single division. Some few
years before his time it had begun to be the custom to carry the eagle
only into battle, the other standards being left behind in camp. Marius
however abolished the rest of them entirely.</p></div>

<p>The <em>vexillum</em> consisted of a square piece of material, usually red
or purple but sometimes white or blue, hung by the top edge (or
sometimes its two top corners only) from a cross-piece at the head
of a lance and heavily fringed along its bottom edge. The peculiar
method of attachment at the corners, which caused it to hang in heavy
folds instead of straight down, would seem to indicate an origin
similar to that of the Greek "Phoinikis." This was the standard appropriated
to the cavalry and to the special detachments of infantry,
and it is said to be the oldest of the Roman military standards. It
hung before the General's tent and was used in giving the signal to
prepare for battle<a name="FNanchor_24" id="FNanchor_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a>. From its use in this connection it naturally became
the sign of a commander of a fleet of ships<a name="FNanchor_25" id="FNanchor_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> and was used in giving
the signal for fleet actions.</p>

<p>Flavius Vegetius<a name="FNanchor_26" id="FNanchor_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a>, writing at the close of the fourth century <span class="smcap">a.d.</span>,
distinguishes six kinds of military insignia, viz.: aquila, draco, vexillum,
flammula, tufa and pinna. The <em>Draco</em> or dragon had been borrowed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>from the Parthians after the death of Trajan. It took the form
of a dragon fixed upon a lance with gaping jaws of silver. The body
was of coloured silk, and when the wind blew down the open jaws the
body was inflated. The <em>Flammula</em> (little flame) was an elongated flag
attached to the staff at the side, split throughout its length so as to
form two narrow streamers. The <em>Tufa</em> seems, from the name, to
have been some form of tuft<a name="FNanchor_27" id="FNanchor_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a> or helmet-crest, but the exact form is
not known. It is of interest as having been adopted in Britain under
the name <em>Tuuf</em><a name="FNanchor_28" id="FNanchor_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a>. <em>Pinnae</em> was the name given to the side wings
of the soldiers' helmets, apparently formed of feathers. The precise
form of the <em>pinna</em> standard is not known, but it is probable that
the fan-shaped feather standards which are displayed at the
coronation of the pope are a survival of this, or the preceding form.</p>

<p>Until the end of the Roman Empire the standard was used at sea
only for signalling purposes or to mark the ship in which the leader
was embarked. Thus in the action off Marseilles in <span class="smcap">b.c.</span> 49, in which
Caesar's fleet under the command of Brutus engaged the Massilian
fleet which was fighting on the side of Pompey, the ship in which
Brutus was embarked was quickly recognised by the leader's standard,
and narrowly escaped being rammed by two triremes from opposite
sides<a name="FNanchor_29" id="FNanchor_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a>.</p>

<p>There are frequent references to this standard in classical writers
and it is often depicted in reliefs or on coins. From these it is clear
that its position was on the starboard quarter of the ship, at the
leader's right hand; it was raised there in going into action, and its
removal was a sign of disaster or retreat. It would seem that it was
also removed if the fleet was about to be engaged by superior forces,
presumably in order that the enemy might not concentrate against
the leader's ship. Thus in <span class="smcap">b.c.</span> 36 Octavian, when expecting an attack
at sea by Pompey, embarked in a liburnian and sailed round the fleet
exhorting his men to have courage. When he had done this he lowered
his standard "as is the custom in times of very great danger<a name="FNanchor_30" id="FNanchor_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a>."</p>

<p>Pompey, whose success at sea had already induced him to exchange
the customary purple cloak of the Roman commander for a
dark blue one, "as the adopted son of Neptune," inflicted on Octavian
the defeat that the latter had anticipated, but was shortly afterwards
himself defeated at Naulochus by Agrippa, whom Octavian, a few
years later, after the battle of Actium, honoured with a special dark
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>blue flag<a name="FNanchor_31" id="FNanchor_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a> as a symbol of his naval superiority. From the account given
by Appian of the action off Naulochus it is clear that there was no
distinguishing flag in the private ships, as he expressly states that the
only difference in the ships of Octavian and Pompey lay in the colours
of the towers erected on them. From another passage in Appian<a name="FNanchor_32" id="FNanchor_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a> it
appears that it was the rule for the inferior commander to lower his
standard on approaching a superior. It is evident that these standards
were not "national" in the sense that our modern flags are national.</p>

<p>It is difficult to understand why an invention so apparently simple
as the laterally-attached flag should have been so late in making its
appearance in Europe (except in the form of small ribbon-like
streamers), but the fact remains that it is not until the close of the
eighth century <span class="smcap">a.d.</span> that we meet with evidence of its existence.
About the year 800 Pope Leo III caused a mosaic to be placed on
the apse of the Triclinium of the Lateran Palace, in which on the
right Christ was represented as handing the keys of the Church to
Pope Sylvester and a flag to Constantine, while on the left St Peter
was handing a pallium to Leo and a similar flag to Charlemagne.
Except for some fragments in the Vatican this mosaic has disappeared,
but engravings showing it before and after restoration are to be found
in a description of the Lateran published at Rome in 1625<a name="FNanchor_33" id="FNanchor_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a>. In these
the flags are depicted as attached by one side to a staff, whilst the fly
is cut into three pointed tails. The field in both flags is charged with six
roses, but the reproduction made from early drawings by Benedict XIV
in 1743, which is still in existence at Rome in the Tribune against the
Santa Scala, shows the flag on the right, which is of a green colour,
sprinkled with golden stars, not roses. In the year 800 Charlemagne
was crowned emperor at Rome, and received from the Patriarch of
Jerusalem the keys of that city together with a flag the form of which
is not stated. Evidently these flags were symbols of authority, as we
have seen the vexillum to have been centuries before.</p>

<p>There are several instances during the succeeding centuries of this
ceremonial presentation of a flag by high ecclesiastical authorities to
the leaders of expeditions whose aims received the approval of the
Church, the most important, from our point of view, being the presentation
made to William the Conqueror before his expedition to
England. Beside these there appear to have been other flags in use
which symbolised the patronage and protection of some especial
saint, as for instance the vexillum of St Maurice borne in the Spanish
campaigns of Charlemagne.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span></p>

<p>It seems probable that the laterally-attached form of flag had its
origin in the East, for Ximenes de Rada, Archbishop of Toledo, who
died in 1247, mentions this form as one of the special characteristics
of the Arabs who overcame Roderic in 711 <span class="smcap">a.d.</span> and conquered
Spain<a name="FNanchor_34" id="FNanchor_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a>.</p>

<p>It is true that, as will be seen in the next chapter, the Danes were
using this form in the ninth century, but it is more probable that they
had adopted it from the Franks than that they had invented it; certainly
the only standards of the Germanic tribes known to the Romans
were animal emblems, which were kept in the sacred groves until
required in battle<a name="FNanchor_35" id="FNanchor_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a>.</p>

<p>The form of flag that first comes into evidence in the Lateran
mosaic, that in which the flag is attached laterally to the staff
while the fly is cut into three pointed tails, appears again upon two
Carlovingian book-covers of carved ivory, one of the ninth and one
of the tenth century, now preserved in South Kensington Museum.
Neither of these bears any device upon it, but in another book-cover
of the twelfth century in the same collection a small cross
saltire appears in the body of the flag, and the tails are proportionately
of much greater length. This form, to which the term "gonfanon"
became applied, was the principal form in use until the twelfth century,
when it began to be replaced by the rectangular banner, which
offered a more suitable field for the display of the personal devices
that afterwards developed into heraldic charges.</p>

<p>The most important historical monument that has survived to illustrate
the use of the gonfanon is the celebrated piece of embroidery
known as the Bayeux Tapestry. We need not here enter into the controversy
that has so long raged over the question of the exact date to
be assigned to this unique work. The weight of evidence inclines
strongly toward a date within the last two decades of the eleventh century,
but if we admit a date as late as 1150 <span class="smcap">a.d.</span> it will not materially
affect the conclusions we shall draw. In addition to five rather rudimentary
forms at the mastheads of the ships, twenty-five gonfanons in
all are depicted, two with five tails, one with four, and the remainder
with three. Only a small proportion of the hundreds of armed men
who appear in the various scenes of military activity portrayed bear
gonfanons on their spears. These are the greater leaders&mdash;the barons,
as the Normans called them. The variation in the number of tails is
probably merely an incidental caprice of the designer or embroiderers,
but there is one gonfanon which greatly exceeds the rest in size and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>in the length of its tails, which in this case alone are shown of such
length as to curl in the wind<a name="FNanchor_36" id="FNanchor_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a>. It appears in the representation of
that crucial moment in the battle at which the Normans, taken with
a sudden panic, and believing that their Duke had fallen, were about
to quit the fight, when William, lifting his helmet from his face,
turned towards them and called out that he was still alive and by
God's help would yet conquer. At the same time, a companion figure,
which from the mutilated superscription in the tapestry appears to
be Eustace of Boulogne, lifts this gonfanon high in the air with his
left hand while with the right he points to the Duke's face; a significant
action, calling attention in a twofold manner to William's presence.
This gonfanon is probably the one consecrated and sent by
Pope Alexander; the principal flag of the Norman army on the day
of battle<a name="FNanchor_37" id="FNanchor_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a>. It cannot be supposed that the most elaborate flag in the
whole tapestry is merely the personal gonfanon of Eustace, and indeed
the assertion of M. Marignan that the device shown in this gonfanon
represents the arms of the Counts of Boulogne has been sufficiently
refuted by Dr Round<a name="FNanchor_38" id="FNanchor_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a>. As a matter of fact this device (which may be
described as a cross formy between four roundels) was not an uncommon
one at that period. It will be found upon the reverse of
many of the coins of the Holy Roman Emperors from Charlemagne
onwards and upon those of some of the English monarchs before the
Conquest. On the other hand, the gonfanons which appear in earlier
scenes in the tapestry either in William's hand or in the hand of the
gonfanoner in attendance on him, display only a plain Greek cross.
It is therefore not unreasonable to assume that this particular device
was associated with sovereign power and would consequently be
suitable for a banner that was intended to be an outward sign of the
Pope's claim to transfer the sovereignty of England from Harold to
William. Moreover, according to Wace, William formally adopted
the consecrated gonfanon as his own before the battle:</p>

<div class = "group">
<div class = "onetext" lang="fro" xml:lang="fro">
<p class="no-indent">Li Dus apela un servant<br />
Son gonfanon fist traire avant<br />

E cil le trait, cil le despleia:<br />

</div>

<div class = "onetext">
<p class="no-indent">The Duke called a servant<br />

Which the Pope sent him<br />

<p class="right">
<cite>Roman de Rou</cite>, <span class="smcap">v</span>, 12713-9. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
</div></div>

<p>Thus it appears that William's original gonfanon was not borne
in the battle, but was replaced by the consecrated flag, which would
thereby become the rallying point for the army and the special sign
of the Duke's location in the field.</p>

<p>Raol, who was the hereditary gonfanoner of the Duke of Normandy,
asked permission to decline the honour of bearing the consecrated
flag on the ground that he wished to take part in the fighting,
as did Gautier Giffard, to whom it was subsequently offered, and it
was finally handed to Toustain.</p>

<p>Before we deal with the remaining flags we must first examine
the square object shown at the masthead of William's ship the 'Mora.'
This has been commonly supposed to be the "consecrated banner"
in question, but, as pointed out by Freeman<a name="FNanchor_39" id="FNanchor_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a>, it is really a great
lantern. The Norman army embarked at St Valery in the estuary of
the Somme late in the afternoon of the 27th Sept., and before William
had got on board the 'Mora' the sun had set. As he did not wish the
fleet to make the English coast before daybreak, he gave orders that
on reaching the open sea the ships were to anchor near him until he
gave a signal by lighting the lantern at the masthead and sounding
the trumpet, when they were to follow him across<a name="FNanchor_40" id="FNanchor_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a>. The object above
the lantern, which resembles a cross, may be intended to represent
the weather-vane spoken of by Wace:</p>

<div class = "group">
<div class = "onetext" lang="fro" xml:lang="fro">
<p class="no-indent">Une lanterne fist le Dus<br />

<p class="right">
<cite>Roman de Rou</cite>, <span class="smcap">v</span>, 11592-7. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
</div></div>

<p>The remaining flag of the Norman army is an enigma. In form,
the segment of a circle fringed along the circumference, it contains a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>representation of a bird with closed wings and outstretched claws,
placed with its back to the staff, so that when the spear is held inclined
forward, as in the Tapestry, it appears to be standing on the ground.
The suggestion of Meyrick that this represents an ancestral flag of
the men of the Cotentin, the descendants of the Danes of Harold
Blaatand, is more ingenious than satisfying, for the Danish raven
was never depicted in this tame position. Its attitude resembles that
of the hawks seen perched on Guy's hand in the two early scenes in
which he leads Harold to William, and indeed in the lower border,
which throughout the tapestry contains frequent allusions to the
events depicted above it, there appears immediately below this flag
a hawk chasing a rabbit. From its unusual&mdash;not to say unique&mdash;form
it would seem to belong to a people of different race from that of the
bulk of the army, and the only body of men present in William's
army fulfilling this condition were the Celts of Brittany, whose leader
Alan had command of the third division of the army, and whose flag
therefore must have been one of the most important of those in the field.</p>

</div><div>

<p>On the English side, the most important object is the Dragon
Standard (<a href="#PLATE_I">Plate I</a>, fig. 2) which is symbolically shown in two positions:
upright in the hand of the standard-bearer, and fallen to the ground
with its bearer lying dead across its staff. Immediately behind it
Harold himself is likewise represented twice, first upright and drawing
the arrow from his eye, and then prone, receiving his final wound.
A little before this, in the scene which portrays the death of Harold's
brothers Gyrth and Leofwine, there lies on the ground a triangular
flag, with fringed tails hanging from the lower edge, a form similar to
that found on the tenth century Northumbrian coins<a name="FNanchor_41" id="FNanchor_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a>. This is the
only flag which, like the standard, is lying on the ground; its overthrow
must therefore have had a great symbolic importance in the
mind of the designer of the tapestry, and the only flag that we know
of which would fulfil this condition is that one against which the
brothers took their stand (see <a href="#Page_32">p. 32</a>). This was the flag upon which
the figure of a fighting man was worked in gold, and although the
tapestry does not show this figure (probably because there is not
room for it), there can be little doubt that the representation of that
flag is intended.</p>

<p>We have, in the preceding pages, traced the development of the
flag up to the closing years of the eleventh century without finding
any evidence of the existence of a national flag, that is, of a flag flown,
not to denote the presence of some particular leader at sea or on the
field of battle, or that some especial religious sanction or blessing
had been conferred or expected, but to indicate that the ship, town
or other strong place upon which it was placed owned allegiance to
some particular state or sovereign authority: a flag that might, on
suitable occasion, be flown by any subjects of that state, not as their
personal ensign but as a symbol of the collective body of which they
were members.</p>

<p>While the Roman Empire stood at the height of its power, with
the whole civilised world under its dominion, there was no need of
any such device; and long after it had in fact passed away the theory
of its nominal existence survived and hindered the development of
any national consciousness. It is clear that this feeling must have
been strong since we find it shared by such a man as Theodoric the
Ostrogoth, who, although <em>de facto</em> ruler of Italy from 493 to his death
in 526, professed his allegiance to the Eastern Empire and showed
anxiety to get his position recognised by the Emperor at Constantinople.
The history of the next five hundred years is that of a continuous
succession of struggles for power and possession of territory
between kings, nobles and ecclesiastics, and although the crowning
of Charlemagne by the Pope in 800 was a formal repudiation by
Rome of the authority of the Eastern Emperor there is no indication
that the idea of nationality had yet arisen in the minds of men. The
flag which Leo III presented to him was not in any way a national
emblem; it was the symbol of his supreme authority and no more.
In the ninth and tenth centuries there existed a certain number of
religious flags of greater or less reputation for their wonder-working
powers, of which the Oriflamme of Saint Denis may be taken as the
type, but these were never national in the sense in which we have
defined this word above.</p>

<p>The great movement known as the Crusades, which commenced
at the end of the eleventh century, and after two hundred years of
failure, relieved by a few transient successes, finally exhausted the
enthusiasm of western Europe at the end of the thirteenth century,
has been claimed as one of the main causes of the growth of national
sentiment. In a sense this is no doubt correct, though it is equally
true that its failure was primarily due to the national antagonisms of
the peoples who took part in the expeditions to the Holy Land, and
the partisan jealousies and individual self-seeking of their leaders.
But there is no doubt as to the effect it had in widening the mental<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
horizon of all the peoples of western Europe, and it is therefore not
surprising to find indications of a development of flag design during
the course of the struggle. Nevertheless, if we expect to find traces
of any national or popular flags among the early crusaders we shall
be disappointed. The kings, nobles, and military orders of the Temple
and Hospital had each their own special banner, but the common
people had none, and it was not until the year 1188, one hundred
years after the first crusaders had entered Syria, that a means was
provided for distinguishing the rank and file of different nationalities
by a variation in the colour of the crosses upon their shoulders. From
the beginning, the cross set upon the clothing of rich and poor alike
had been the outward symbol of a common religion and, in theory,
of a common aim among all who took part in the conflicts with the
followers of Mahomet, but the flags which led the armies into action
and crowned the towers of captured castles or the gates of towns
were those of the individual leaders. Squabbles over the precedence
of such flags were not infrequent. The well-known instance of
Richard I and Philip of France at Messina in 1190 was perhaps the
most important in its after effects, but it was by no means the first
or last of such occurrences. In 1098 the Emir in command of one of
the castles in the neighbourhood of Antioch, seeing that the Saracens
had been dispersed, and fearful for the result if the Christians assaulted
the castle, offered to surrender, and asked for a Christian
flag, which he placed on the highest point of the walls. He took that
nearest to hand, which happened to be that of Raymond of Toulouse.
The followers of Bohemond were very angry at this, and in the end
the Emir gave back Raymond's banner and erected that of Bohemond
in its place. In August of the following year the Emir of Ascalon,
frightened by the fall of Jerusalem, made a similar offer of surrender
to Raymond and hoisted his flag over the gate of the city. Godfrey
of Bouillon, who had just been elected ruler of Jerusalem, claimed
possession for himself, whereupon the Emir sent back Raymond's
flag and refused to surrender to either of them.</p>

<p>The placing of the flag of one of the crusading leaders upon
castle or town was usually sufficient to protect that place from further
assault, but it was not always respected. On the capture of Jerusalem
in July, 1099, a remnant of the wretched inhabitants who had escaped
torture and massacre at the hands of the Christians, had taken refuge
on the roof of the mosque which occupied the site of Solomon's
Temple. Tancred, moved by pity, wished to spare them, and he and
Gaston de Bearn gave them their gonfanons as a protection. This
served them for a few hours, but the Crusaders had not tasted enough
blood, and early next morning, ignoring the protection thus formally<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
granted, they shot them down with arrows or put them to the sword&mdash;men
and women alike. Raymond and Tancred had in a like manner
given protection to the defenders of the Tower of David, who received
their flags "as a sign of protection and life." Raymond was
more successful, perhaps because the Tower of David was not so
easily entered, and he succeeded in getting the prisoners away safely,
thereby giving rise to the scandalous imputation that he had neglected
his duty and sold his protection for gold.</p>

<p>Our last instance of the use of the flag during this (the first)
Crusade will concern its employment at sea. In May, 1102, Jaffa
was being threatened by the Saracens, and Baldwin, then King of
Jerusalem, was anxious to encourage the inhabitants to hold out. The
Saracen forces prevented him from getting there by land; he therefore
embarked at Arsuf in a buss, together with one Goderic, who is
described by Albert of Aix as an English pirate. On approaching
Jaffa the flag of Baldwin was fastened to a spear and raised high
in the sun, so that the Christians in Jaffa, on seeing it, might be
sure that Baldwin was still living. The Saracens also recognised it,
and hastily collecting a force of twenty galleys and thirteen other
craft, attempted to sink the buss. The king, however, got through
in safety.</p>

<p>We have, unfortunately, no exact description of the various flags
mentioned, for the contemporary writers do not condescend to give
such details, though they occasionally allude to some characteristic
feature. Thus the flag of Bohemond is stated to have been of a red
colour (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">rubicundum, sanguineum</i>) while that of Robert of Normandy
was yellow (<em>aureum</em>). That of Baldwin is referred to several times as
being white. On one occasion it was torn from his lance through
being driven into the body of an Arab whom he slew. The flags<a name="FNanchor_42" id="FNanchor_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a>
borne on lances in battle were evidently of gonfanon form, as there
are several references to the tails flying in the faces or over the heads
of the enemy, but it seems that there were also a number of larger
flags, for several of the greater leaders, including Bishop Adhemar the
Papal Legate, had a special flag-bearer (<em>vexillifer</em>). These were probably
also of gonfanon form during the First Crusade, for the deep
rectangular banner does not appear to have been introduced until
the Second Crusade.</p>

<p>It seems that crosses were borne in some of the flags, but there is
no mention of any personal device, though some flags are stated to
have been resplendent with purple and precious stones. It is commonly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
supposed that the introduction to western Europe of the cross of
St George (the red cross on white ground) dates from this first crusade,
yet it does not appear at that time to have been associated with
him. On the 28th June, 1098, the crusaders besieged in Antioch by
Corbogha, finding themselves within measurable distance of destruction
by famine, determined to risk all upon a pitched battle. In this
forlorn hope they were completely successful. Unable to account for
this by any earthly cause, they imagined that they had seen a great
army on white horses, clothed in white and bearing white banners in
their hands, issue from the neighbouring mountains and come to
their assistance. The leaders of this ghostly army, recognised by
their names written on their banners, were St George, St Demetrius,
and St Mercurius<a name="FNanchor_43" id="FNanchor_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a>. If at this time the red cross had become the distinctive
sign of St George one or other of these writers would surely
have mentioned it, but all agree that the banners were white.</p>

<p>We may gather a few more details regarding the flags of the
crusading period from some of the earlier <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">chansons de geste</i>. The
gonfanon, the use of which was confined to the nobility, was fastened
to the shaft of the spear before going into action by three or five
nails<a name="FNanchor_44" id="FNanchor_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a>, and it must have needed a strong fastening if it was to remain
on the spear throughout the battle. Indeed, the poets give a realistic
touch to their descriptions of the various combats by narrating how
their heroes drove the cloth of the gonfanon into the body of the foe.
As they sat upright upon their horses the tails of the gonfanon reached
down to their hands or even to their feet.</p>

</p>

<p>The designs are simple in colour&mdash;red, white, yellow&mdash;and there
is no mention of any charge upon them, though in one instance a
red gonfanon is marked by a golden cross:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza" lang="fro" xml:lang="fro">

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span></p>

<p class="no-indent">The pennons were carried by knights; they appear to have been of
similar colours to the gonfanons, but were much smaller.</p>

<p class="right"><cite>Ogier l'Ardenois</cite>, <em>v.</em> 4440. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; </p>

<p>We have already noticed that the name "Standard" appears first
applied to a Saracen ensign. Further corroboration of this is supplied
by the <cite>Chanson d'Antioche</cite> and <cite>Le Conquête de Jerusalem</cite>. In the latter
poem the author (Richard the Pilgrim) has imagined a wonderful
standard carried on an iron chariot and made of ivory and various
precious woods, and of an enormous height:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza" lang="fro" xml:lang="fro">
<span class="i0">L. toises longes i puet on brachoier<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Onques nus homs de char ne vit si haut clochier.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The custom of marking the flag with some distinctive heraldic
device appears to have been introduced about the middle of the
twelfth century, for the seal of Philip of Flanders (A.D. 1161) shows
the Flemish lion on his banner. During the Third Crusade, which
followed upon the re-capture of Jerusalem by Saladin (October,
1187), the banner<a name="FNanchor_45" id="FNanchor_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a> of Richard I of England, which flew from the top
of the "Standard" already described, contained a single lion, while
that of his great rival, Philip Augustus of France, was blue powdered
with gold fleurs-de-lis. The Knights of the Temple, who first come
into view in 1128, adopted a banner half black and half white (drear
and black to their foes but fair and favourable to their friends) to
which they gave the name <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">bauçan</i><a name="FNanchor_46" id="FNanchor_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a>. Their rivals, the Knights of the
Hospital of St John in Jerusalem, who first enter into military activity
in 1136, had a red banner with a white cross upon it. The representation
in <a href="#PLATE_I">Plate I</a> (fig. 5) is taken from an early manuscript of Matthew
Paris and shows a Latin cross; the eight-pointed cross<a name="FNanchor_47" id="FNanchor_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a>, associated
with this order, was rarely used except on the vestments of the order,
though it occasionally appears on the banner of the commander-in-chief.</p>

<p>Mention has already been made of the consecrated flags which it
was customary for the Pope to present to the leaders of expeditions
which had the approbation of the Church. The flag entrusted to the
Bishop of Puy, the Papal Legate present at the First Crusade, was of
this nature. It is referred to in 1098 as the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">signum magni papae</i>. In
1104 when Paschal sent Bohemond into France to gather support for
him against the Emperor, he entrusted him with another of these
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>flags, to which the name <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">vexillum Sancti Petri</i> is applied. This change
of name would appear to indicate a difference in the device on the
flag. That difference was probably the introduction of the two Keys
of St Peter beside the cross, a point of some interest to us as it might
affect the question of the identity of the gonfanon on the Bayeux
Tapestry already discussed, and incidentally the date of that work.
We have, however, no certain knowledge of the presence of these
keys before the year 1203. In March of that year Innocent III sent
to Calojohannes, King of the Bulgars and Wends, one of these flags,
together with a letter in which he explained its symbolism at some
length. This flag contained a cross and the two keys symbolic of the
powers entrusted to Peter according to the tradition of the Church<a name="FNanchor_48" id="FNanchor_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a>.
From the tenor of this letter it may be inferred that the device was
not a new one in 1203, so that this was no doubt the device upon the
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">vexillum S. Petri</i> met with during the Third Crusade in 1199 and
1201. An interesting instance of the use of a flag to convey authority
occurs in 1216, when Rupen, nephew of Leo of Armenia, was formally
seised of the lordship of Antioch by the patriarch of that city handing
him a flag in the church of St Peter.</p>

<p>Thus far we are still without evidence of the existence of any
flag that could be described as "national," and we shall therefore
turn our attention to the birthplace of so much that was great in
art and literature, the Italian city-states, and since we are primarily
seeking evidence as to the early use of the flag at sea (though hitherto
without much success) we shall turn first to the maritime states of
Genoa and Pisa.</p>

<p>Of these two, Pisa was the first to rise as an important maritime
city, and in 980 she was supplying vessels to transport the troops of
the Emperor Otho II. By the end of the eleventh century a system of
government by Consuls had been firmly established, and the city can
be looked upon as an independent state. Shortly after this (in 1114)
the Pisans proceeded to capture the Balearic Isles from the Saracens.
A contemporary metrical account<a name="FNanchor_49" id="FNanchor_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a> of this struggle gives an indication
of the flags then in use in the following words:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza" lang="la" xml:lang="la">
<span class="i0">Tunc vexilla gerens Pisanae signifer urbis<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Valandus cuneos in campum ducit apertum.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hinc Ildebrandus sanctae vexilla Mariae<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Consul habens dextra saevos incurrit in hostes,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sedis Apostolicae vexillum detulit Atho.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span></p>

<p>Here we have evidence of at least three different flags in the Pisan
host: the Standard-bearer of the city carries the communal flag, the
nature of which is not indicated (in 1242 and 1350 it was a plain red
flag); Hildebrand the Consul carries a flag<a name="FNanchor_50" id="FNanchor_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a> of the B. V. Mary; and
Atho carries the papal flag<a name="FNanchor_51" id="FNanchor_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a>, which had no doubt been presented by
the Pope when sending his benediction to the expedition through
the Archbishop of Pisa. These flags were fastened to spears (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">hastis
vexilla micabant</i>) which were used in the conflict without regard to
the sanctity of the emblems borne on them:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza" lang="la" xml:lang="la">
<span class="i0">Tunc Ildebrandus consul dirum Niceronta<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Transfodiens ferro per pectus dirigit hastam<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Vexillumque trahit madefactum sanguine Mauri.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p class="no-indent">This matter-of-fact method of utilising the flag of the B. V. Mary
by thrusting its staff through the breast of an enemy and withdrawing
it stained with his blood does not accord with modern notions of the
sanctity of the flag.</p>

<p>The first important step in the rise of Genoa occurred in 958,
when Berengarius and Adalbert guaranteed its communal rights.
Some thirty years after this the Cathedral was founded, and as it
was dedicated to St Lawrence it is evident that at this early date
St George had not yet become the patron saint of the city.</p>

<p>The original manuscript of the <cite>Annales Genuenses</cite>, which narrate
(not without partisan bias) the principal events affecting the state
and its relations with Pisa and other rivals during the twelfth and
thirteenth centuries, was at one time in the Archives of Genoa, but
it is now in the Bibliothèque Nationale at Paris. Commenced by
Caffaro in 1154 on the basis of a diary of events, which he had kept
since early youth, and continued from time to time by later writers
under the instructions of the municipal authorities, it presents a contemporary
record from the year 1099 to 1293, and, what is even more
important for our purpose, it contains in its margin a number of illustrations
in which flags appear both ashore and afloat.</p>

<p>Evidently, at some date after 958 the Genoese transferred their
spiritual allegiance from St Lawrence to St George in much the same
way that the Venetians had transferred their allegiance from St Theodore
to St Mark when the supposed relics of that saint were translated
from Alexandria to Venice, or as the English, in the fourteenth century,
replaced Edward the Confessor by St George, but it is not until
the year 1198 that we meet with a distinct reference by name to the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>flag of St George as being that of the State. From that year onward it
is frequently referred to in terms which leave no doubt that it had
been the outward symbol of Genoese power from a much earlier
period. Indeed, in an illustration, against the year 1113, of the castle
of Porto Venere, then newly built by the Genoese, there flies above
the castle a large three-tailed gonfanon bearing a cross that extends
to the three sides and to the commencement of the tails. This is a
pen-and-ink sketch, so that the colour of the cross is not shown, but
there can be little doubt that this was a flag of St George. I say <em>a</em> flag
of St George because, although the red cross on white was ultimately
adopted as the State ensign, <em>the</em> State flag of St George in the thirteenth
century was not a cross at all; it was an actual representation of
St George himself on horseback in the familiar attitude of slaying
the dragon with a spear. This is shown clearly in a coloured miniature
which accompanies the events of 1227. In that year, at the commencement
of the struggle between the papacy and the Emperor,
the Genoese laid siege to Savona and the neighbouring town of
Albizzola, which were attempting to withdraw from their allegiance
to their great neighbour and to take sides with the Emperor Frederick.
The artist depicts the siege operations against these two towns, and
shows the principal citizens of Savona on their knees before the
Podesta of Genoa in his tent, humbly offering their submission<a name="FNanchor_52" id="FNanchor_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a>.
Before the tent floats a large red gonfanon, rectangular in form, and
with four square-ended tails, having the above-mentioned device in
a light yellow colour, and the word "vexillum" written under it to
call attention to the fact that it was the State flag.</p>

<p>The record of the events in 1242 provides a typical example of
the use of this flag of St George by the Genoese. Having heard on
the 10th July that the Emperor Frederick had sent sixty galleys and
two great ships under the command of Ansaldus de Mari to Pisa,
and that the Pisans were themselves fitting out fifty-eight galleys and
other vessels under Buscarius Pisanus, the Genoese immediately fitted
out eighty-three galleys, with thirteen tarids<a name="FNanchor_53" id="FNanchor_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a> and four great ships,
at Genoa. These were all painted white with red crosses in lieu of
the sea-green colour in which they had hitherto been accustomed to
paint their vessels<a name="FNanchor_54" id="FNanchor_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a>. Instructions were then sent throughout all the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>districts owning allegiance to the city that all men should prepare to
embark, armed and supplied with victuals. The Podesta<a name="FNanchor_55" id="FNanchor_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a> then collected
the people in the Square of St Lawrence, and after delivering
an oration encouraging them for the coming conflict, he, amid general
rejoicing, solemnly took possession of the state flag of St George,
"to the honour of God and of Holy Church and the confusion of
their enemies," and constituted himself Admiral of the fleet. His next
step was to superintend the election of eight Protentini and ninety-six
Comiti according to districts<a name="FNanchor_56" id="FNanchor_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a>. He then handed to each Protentinus,
who became the Squadron Commander of one of the eight squadrons
into which the fleet was divided, a splendidly worked flag embodying
the device of his district (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">vexillum unum juxta formam cuiuslibet compagnae
mirabiliter designatum</i>) and to each Comitus two flags; one of
the State device (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">vexillum ad signum communis</i>), evidently the red
cross of St George, which he was to place on the starboard quarter
of his ship, and the other containing the lion of St Mark (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">vexillum
ad signum Venetorum Sancti Marchi</i>), which was to be placed on the
port quarter. This is an extraordinary instance of the use of dual
national flags in a fleet, and was the consequence of a treaty made
between Genoa and Venice in 1238 whereby the two great rival sea
powers agreed that their war vessels should bear the flags of both
States as a token of amity and alliance between them. The Admiral's
flag was then erected in one of the best galleys, and the Protentini
(Squadron Commanders) and Comiti (Captains) proceeded to hoist
theirs in the galleys and tarids assigned to them, which were then
apportioned off to the various squadrons. No officers were appointed
to the four great ships (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">naves magnae</i>), which were evidently victualling
and store ships, relying almost entirely upon sail power for propulsion
and therefore of little use in fighting at that period. As there
were 96 comiti and 96 fighting ships, it is clear that the galleys of the
Admiral and of the eight Protentini had each three flags, the State
flag and the district flags being probably placed in the bows. This
appears to be the first recorded instance of the division of a fleet into
squadrons by means of flags. The most striking detail of the
interesting events in 1227 and 1242&mdash;one that has hitherto escaped
attention&mdash;is the fact that in the Republic of Genoa, one of the earliest
States to adopt a national flag, two forms of that flag existed side by
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>side; one containing a representation of the patron saint (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">vexillum
Beati Georgii</i>) flown only in the presence of the chief of the State or
the Commander-in-chief, the other containing merely the red cross
emblematic of that saint, the general device of the community
(<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">signum communis</i>), in other words the flag of the common people.
Thus the supreme power and the common source of that power are
represented distinctly, and in such a way as to indicate that fundamentally
they were one and the same thing.</p>

<p>There are other instances in these Annals from which it is clear
that the flag of St George was erected only in the galley of the
Admiral. Indeed in 1282 it was expressly ordained by the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Sapientes
Credentiae</i> (Council of XV) that no leader should have the title of
Admiral, but only of Captain, unless he had at least ten galleys under
his command, and that the flag of St George should not be borne at
sea unless the fleet comprised ten or more galleys.</p>

<p>On the farther side of Italy another great maritime power had
sprung into existence at Venice. Owing to its remoteness from the
lines of military communication and the protection of its surrounding
lagoons, Venice enjoyed a comparative immunity from outside interference
that enabled her to form a settled government at a much
earlier date than had been possible at Genoa or Pisa, although the
city was of much later origin. In such circumstances one might suppose
that the Venetians would choose a national symbol at an early
period, and that the famous Lion of St Mark was adopted for this
purpose shortly after the translation of the relics of that saint to
Venice in 828 <span class="smcap">a.d.</span><a name="FNanchor_57" id="FNanchor_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a> I have, however, not met with any reference to
this celebrated flag earlier than the passage in which Villehardouin
describes the attack of the Crusaders on Constantinople in July, 1203.
As the fleet approached the walls of the city the aged and blind Doge
Dandolo stood at the prow of his galley with the Gonfanon of St Mark
displayed before him. When he landed the Gonfanon was carried
before him,</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="no-indent">And when the Venetians saw the Gonfanon of St Mark on land and
the galley of their leader which had been beached in front of them, then
each man felt himself shamed, and all approached the land, and those in
the huissiers (horse transports) leapt out and went on shore, and those in
the great ships got into barges and got to the shore as quickly as each one
could.</p></div>

<p class="no-indent">It will be noted that there was but one gonfanon of St Mark, that
borne before the leader, although there were evidently many other
flags, for in describing the preparation of the fleet for action a little<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
earlier Villehardouin states that banners and gonfanons were erected
on the castles of the ships, and that shields were placed along the
sides<a name="FNanchor_58" id="FNanchor_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a>.</p>

<p>Here we have evidently an arrangement of flags somewhat similar
to that already described as prevailing in the Genoese fleet. The
State flag is confided to the commander-in-chief, while other ships
display the banners of the subordinate leaders.</p>

<p>But it is doubtful whether the idea of a national ensign originated
in the maritime states. The first of the Italian cities to adopt a democratic
form of government was Milan, where the people, under the
leadership of their Archbishop, Aribert, successfully resisted the
Emperor Conrad himself. In the course of the struggle, about the
year 1038, Aribert introduced as a rallying point for his people in
battle a movable standard, which is described by Arnulf as a lofty
beam, like the mast of a ship, fixed on a strong wagon and bearing
a golden apple at the summit, from which hung two white streamers
(<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">pendentibus duobus candissimi veli limbis</i>). Midway on this pole was
placed a crucifix, to which the eyes of the citizens might turn for
comfort whatever the fortunes of the fight might be. This device
was afterwards adopted by most of the city-states of Italy, and under
the name of <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">carroccio</i> (chariot) will be met with frequently in their
annals. In its later development an altar was placed at the base of the
mast, while the wagon, drawn by white oxen, was hung with scarlet
cloth and the city flag floated at the masthead.</p>

<p>Among the cities that adopted this form of standard were Cremona,
where it was named "Berta," Brescia, Bologna, Florence and Parma.
In the case of Parma, where the standard was called "Blancardo,"
an interesting instance of its symbolic importance other than in battle
is recorded. In 1303, when Ghiberto of Correggio obtained possession
of that city, he got himself confirmed as "lord, defender, and protector
of that city, and was invested by the resignation into his hands
of the standard of the Virgin and the flag of the Carroccio<a name="FNanchor_59" id="FNanchor_59"></a><a href="#Footnote_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a>."</p>

<p>This investiture by flag, already illustrated in the case of Charlemagne
and Rupen, is worthy of two further illustrations. In 1329
Padua recognised Alberto della Scala as its lord by presenting him
with the flag of the people (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">vexillum populi</i>) in public assembly, and
in 1406 acknowledged its overthrow by Venice by presenting the
same symbol to the Doge Steno. In this year also Verona acknowledged
its defeat by surrendering to the Venetians its communal flag
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>(a white cross on red ground) and its <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">vexillum populi</i> (a golden cross
on azure field).</p>

<p>As a final example of the use of flags in the mediaeval Italian
republics we may take the case of Florence. In October, 1250, in the
course of a sanguinary struggle between the Guelphs and <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;original text: Ghibbellines">Ghibellines</ins>,
the popular party (then Guelph)</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="no-indent">marched in military array to San Lorenzo, and there elected thirty
leaders, annulled a portion of the functions of the Podestà, and appointed
as guardian of the new government a captain of the people, Messer Uberto
da Lucca, with whom were to be associated twelve elders (two for each
division of the town) as councillors for him and advisers of the people.</p>

<p>The captain was to be a foreigner; but the elders were to be Florentines.</p>

<p>The fighting population was divided into twenty companies each with
a standard of its own, and the force thus created was intended, under the
leadership of the captain, to defend the liberties of the people within the
town. Outside Florence the army was still to be commanded by the
Podestà. The captain's standard showed a red cross on a white field: to
this day the ensign of the town of Florence. The nobles and the powerful
burghers (popolani) formed a separate force&mdash;that of the knights. Each
sesto or division of the town had a separate ensign for its troop of cavalry,
and these banners, with many others, were given solemnly by the Podestà
on every Whitsunday.</p>

<p>The contado was also divided into companies under respective standards,
and when called into the town, fell naturally into line with the
city bands.</p>

<p>All these changes were intended to check the power of the Ghibellines,
who soon came to be so hated by the majority of Florentines that a common
banner even was felt as an intolerable evil, and the Guelph party adopted
a red lily on a white field, leaving the white lily on a red field (the old arms
of the commune) to the opposite faction<a name="FNanchor_60" id="FNanchor_60"></a><a href="#Footnote_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a>.</p></div>

<p>Here again we have two national flags as at Genoa, but with a
marked difference in the underlying meaning. One, the red flag with
white lily, the ensign of the aristocratic classes: the other, the red
cross, that of the common people.</p>

<p>From the facts set forth in the preceding pages (and they are
supported by a number of less important details with which we
shall not weary the readers' attention) it may be inferred that national
flags came into being during the course of the twelfth century and
had a twofold origin. In the case of the smaller states organised on
a popular basis under continually changing Consuls or magistrates,
they arose from the necessity of having some clearly recognisable
rallying point in action that was not personal and therefore subject
to frequent change. This was supplied either by a common devotion
to a particular saint, as at Genoa and Venice, or by the adoption of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
one particular colour, as at Pisa, or in the solitary case of Rome, the
greatest of all in wealth of historic memories, by the re-adoption of
an ancient classic device, the S.P.Q.R. of the Senatus Populusque
Romanus. In the larger states, which from their very size were at that
period necessarily organised on a feudal basis, the banner of the
sovereign lord became the national flag. This was what happened in
France and (as will appear in the next chapter) also happened in
England.</p>

<p>In this, the most memorable advance in the use of flags, it was
the city-states of Italy that led the way; and it was the great development
during the Crusades of the activity of the maritime states of
Genoa, Venice and Pisa that spread the example throughout Europe.</p>

<p>By the end of the thirteenth century the maritime city-states of
northern Europe, which had arisen to prominence in consequence
of the development of their shipping under the influence of the
Crusades, had begun to make regulations governing the use of their
flags at sea. Thus the maritime laws of Hamburg, to which Pardessus<a name="FNanchor_61" id="FNanchor_61"></a><a href="#Footnote_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a>
assigns a date prior to 1270, contained a provision to the effect that
every burgher of that town should fly at sea a red flag<a name="FNanchor_62" id="FNanchor_62"></a><a href="#Footnote_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a>, under penalty
of three silver marks, unless the flag had been lowered in time of
danger, and a like penalty was to be inflicted on any stranger who
flew this flag, on plaint being made against him. A similar provision
appears in the Maritime Law of Riga of the same date, with the
difference that the flag is to bear a white cross, the colour of the field
not being stated, though at a later date it is given as black. The Laws
of Lubeck contain a like provision in 1299, the "Lubeschen Vloghel<a name="FNanchor_63" id="FNanchor_63"></a><a href="#Footnote_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a>"
being presumably the flag, white and red in two horizontal bands,
flown by that town until its absorption into the German Empire.</p>

<p>Two years earlier, in 1297, appeared the first recorded provision
for the bearing of an English flag at sea, and we may therefore, with
the close of the thirteenth century, quit the wide field of research
that we have been attempting to survey for a more detailed investigation
of the history of British national flags.</p>

The other writers do not concur. His theory that the boards which formed
the aphlaston were movable and, supported by the "stylis," served to aid the navigation
of the ship will not, I think, command many adherents.</p></div>

Freeman says "I cannot see the banner in the tapestry," but if he was looking for
a "banner" he certainly would not find one at this early date, and Wace (v, 11451)
expressly says that it was a "gonfanon": "L'Apostoile...un gonfanon li enveia."
Freeman supposes (p. 768) that at this point Eustace is giving advice to which

 The tarid at this date was shorter and broader than the galley, and therefore
able to carry a heavier burden, but it was on this account less mobile, and therefore
defensive rather than offensive in action. These tarids were fitted out with fighting
castles (<em>hediffitia</em> (aedificia) <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">mirabilia ad proelium</i>) to increase their defensive
qualities.</p></div>

 The term "Protentinus" was adopted from the Normans then ruling in Sicily,
who had acquired it from the Byzantines. As in Sicily, the Protentinus appears to
have been primarily the chief magistrate of one of the districts (compagnae) into
which the state territory was divided for administrative purposes, the "comitus"
being one of his subordinate officers. Thus the fleet was organised on a territorial
basis. The term "comitus" was afterwards applied to the officer occupying the
position of boatswain in a galley, but it has not that meaning at this date.</p></div>

<h3><i>Early English, Scottish, and Irish Flags</i></h3>

<h4><a name="Chapter_IIa" id="Chapter_IIa"></a><a href="#CONTENTS">(i) ENGLAND</a></h4>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">So</span> far as may be judged from the scanty records that remain, the
ancient inhabitants of these islands do not seem to have known the
use of flags until the Romans made them acquainted with their military
<em>signa</em>. Adopted by the Saxons either directly from the Romans
before they left their homes on the continent or from the Britons
whom they subdued, flags formed, from the seventh century onwards,
an important part of the regalia. Speaking of Eadwin King of Northumbria,
under date 628 <span class="smcap">a.d.</span>, the Venerable Bede says:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="no-indent">his dignity was so great throughout his dominions that banners
(vexilla) were not only borne before him in battle, but even in time of
peace when he rode about his cities and towns or provinces the standard
bearer was wont to go before him. And when he walked about the streets
that sort of standard which the Romans call Tufa, and the English Tuuf,
was borne before him<a name="FNanchor_64" id="FNanchor_64"></a><a href="#Footnote_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a>.</p></div>

<p class="no-indent">A few years later, on the translation of the bones of King Oswald,
the royal vexillum of purple and gold (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">auro et purpura compositum</i>)
was placed above the tomb, a practice that was followed through
many centuries.</p>

<p>The Saxons of Wessex adopted as their principal war standard
the dragon, which in various forms was destined to appear at many
crucial moments in English history. At the battle of Burford in 752,
according to Henry of Huntingdon, the Wessex standard was a golden
dragon, while the Mercians used the vexillum<a name="FNanchor_65" id="FNanchor_65"></a><a href="#Footnote_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a>.</p>

<p>The Danish vikings, who commenced their descents upon the
southern coasts of England in the middle of the ninth century, had
as their ensign a raven embroidered in a flag, which appears to have
been used for divination. In the year 878 Hubba</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="no-indent">the brother of Hingwar and Halfdene, with 23 ships ... sailed to Devon,
where with 1200 others he met with a miserable death, being slain before
the castle of Cynuit<a name="FNanchor_66" id="FNanchor_66"></a><a href="#Footnote_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a>.
 There (the Christians<a name="FNanchor_67" id="FNanchor_67"></a><a href="#Footnote_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a>) gained a very large booty,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>and amongst other things the flag called Raven<a name="FNanchor_68" id="FNanchor_68"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a>, for they say that the
three sisters of Hingwar and Hubba, daughters of Lodobroch, wove that
flag and got it ready in one day. They say moreover that in every battle
wherever that flag went before them, if they were to gain the victory a live
raven would appear flying in the middle of the flag, but if they were doomed
to be defeated it would hang down motionless, and this often proved to
be so<a name="FNanchor_69" id="FNanchor_69"></a><a href="#Footnote_69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a>.</p></div>

<p>From this description it is clear that the raven flag was attached
by one side to a staff, instead of by the top to a crosspiece like the
Roman vexillum. We meet with it next at the beginning of the
eleventh century, when the Danish hordes again invaded England
under Sweyn and Cnut and conquered it. The anonymous author of
the <cite>Encomium</cite> of Queen Emma, the wife of Cnut, gives a description
of the flag and attributes to it magical properties, in which he is good
enough not to expect his readers to believe. He says:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>For they had a flag of wondrous portent, which, though I may well
believe this to be incredible to the reader, yet because it is true I will mention
it in this truthful account. Of a truth, although it was woven of quite
plain white silk and there was no image of any kind in it, yet in time of
war there always appeared in it a raven, as though it were woven thereon,
which when its own party was victorious appeared with open beak, shaking
its wings and moving its legs, but when that party was defeated, very
quiet and with its whole body hanging down (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">toto corpore demissus</i>)<a name="FNanchor_70" id="FNanchor_70"></a><a href="#Footnote_70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a>.</p></div>

<p>Possibly this flag was triangular, for in the early years of the tenth
century the viking kings of Northumbria introduced into the reverse
of their coins a triangular flag affixed laterally to a staff<a name="FNanchor_71" id="FNanchor_71"></a><a href="#Footnote_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a>. The top
edge of this was horizontal and the lower, which was inclined upward
from the staff, was heavily fringed. In the field was a small cross,
which had&mdash;possibly under the influence of a nominal christianity&mdash;replaced
the raven, although that bird is found on the obverse of
some of the later coins<a name="FNanchor_72" id="FNanchor_72"></a><a href="#Footnote_72" class="fnanchor">[72]</a>. These coins are of especial interest to us as
they contain the earliest representation of a flag of any of the northern
nations. This triangular flag appears first in a coin of Sihtric, who,
after being driven from Dublin by the Irish in 920, reigned at York
and died about 927, and later in a coin of Regnald (King of Northumbria
in 943) and upon coins of Anlaf (949-952)<a name="FNanchor_73" id="FNanchor_73"></a><a href="#Footnote_73" class="fnanchor">[73]</a>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span></p>

<p>It is about this period that flags first become associated with particular
saints. Among the treasures sent by Hugh the Great, Duke of
the Franks, to King Æthelstan in 927 was a banner of St Maurice,
which is said to have been of especial assistance to Charlemagne in
his Spanish wars<a name="FNanchor_74" id="FNanchor_74"></a><a href="#Footnote_74" class="fnanchor">[74]</a>. We do not know what form this banner took, presumably
it was a representation of the saint, but it is of especial
significance to us that this saint had been a soldier, for it enables us
in some measure to understand why St George had such an extraordinary
vogue a few centuries later.</p>

<p>At the battle of Assandune (1016) in which the English under
Eadmund Ironside were defeated by the Danes under Sweyn and
Cnut, the Raven was opposed to the Dragon and to another ensign
described as a "Standard." This is the first occasion on which an
English king appears in the field with two different "standards,"
and it is of interest to note that his place in battle was between
them<a name="FNanchor_75" id="FNanchor_75"></a><a href="#Footnote_75" class="fnanchor">[75]</a>.</p>

<p>It is to be regretted that Henry of Huntingdon did not explain
what this royal "Standard," for which he has no exact Latin equivalent,
was like. He tells us that Harold also had a "Standard" (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">signum
regium quod vocatur Standard</i>) at the Battle of Hastings, and that a
band of Norman knights bound themselves by oath to seize it: an
effort in which they were successful, although many were slain. This
Standard was apparently the "Dragon" seen in the Bayeux Tapestry
in the hands of Harold's standard-bearer<a name="FNanchor_76" id="FNanchor_76"></a><a href="#Footnote_76" class="fnanchor">[76]</a>. According to William of
Malmesbury<a name="FNanchor_77" id="FNanchor_77"></a><a href="#Footnote_77" class="fnanchor">[77]</a>, Harold, who was fighting on foot, placed himself with
his brothers near his <em>vexillum</em>, which was in the likeness of a man
fighting, and was sumptuously adorned with gold and precious stones.
After the battle William presented it to the Pope. Probably this fighting
man was the emblem of the South-Saxons, for on the Sussex
Downs above Wilmington&mdash;once the home of Earl Godwin, Harold's
father&mdash;may be seen the outline of a gigantic figure armed with a
staff or lance in either hand<a name="FNanchor_78" id="FNanchor_78"></a><a href="#Footnote_78" class="fnanchor">[78]</a>. Evidently Harold's position was between
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>the Dragon standard, and his personal ensign, a position similar to
that occupied "according to custom" by Eadmund fifty years before.</p>

<p>Of these two the "signum regium," or principal "standard"
appears to have been fixed in a central position or rallying point,
while the other, the Dragon, was carried in the hands of a standard-bearer
chosen for his personal strength and prowess. In September
of the year 1191 when Richard was fighting in the Holy Land in
company with the French under the Duke of Burgundy, and the
crusading army was drawn up for battle, Richard fixed his standard
in the midst of the forces and handed the Dragon to Peter des Preaux
to carry, despite the claim of Robert Trussebut to bear it by hereditary
right<a name="FNanchor_79" id="FNanchor_79"></a><a href="#Footnote_79" class="fnanchor">[79]</a>. By this time the royal "standard" supported an heraldic
banner that displayed the lion which Richard placed upon his first
great seal and which on his return to England he multiplied by three;
but why did a symbol so obviously pagan as the Dragon survive the
Conquest and that greater attention to religion&mdash;or at any rate to its
outward observance&mdash;that the Conquest had brought in its train?
William of Normandy had conquered England beneath the aegis of
the gonfanon with golden cross that the Pope had blessed for him,
yet we hear no more of it. The battle of the Standard in 1138 was
fought around a ship's mast bearing aloft the banners of St Peter,
St John of Beverley and St Wilfred of Ripon. The very crusade in
which Richard was engaged had been inaugurated with the solemn
assumption of coloured crosses by the combatants at the hands of
the Archbishop of Tyre, white for the English, red for the French,
and green for the men of Flanders<a name="FNanchor_80" id="FNanchor_80"></a><a href="#Footnote_80" class="fnanchor">[80]</a>. Yet the standard under which
the English crusaders were led to the attack was none of these, but
the same Dragon under which the Parthians had fought the Romans
and the men of Wessex had beaten the men of Mercia. And the
chronicler who records this fact was an eye-witness.</p>

<p>When, in the twenty-eighth year of his reign, Henry III was
about to visit the Abbey at Westminster, which he was rebuilding,</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="no-indent">he commanded Edward FitzOdo to make a Dragon in the manner of a
Standard or Ensign of red Samit, to be embroidered with gold, and his
tongue to appear as though continually moving and his eyes of Saphires
or other stones agreeable to him<a name="FNanchor_81" id="FNanchor_81"></a><a href="#Footnote_81" class="fnanchor">[81]</a></p></div>

<p class="no-indent">which was to be placed in the Abbey Church against the King's
coming thither. What then was its religious significance?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span></p>

<p>But we must leave this question to the student of folklore<a name="FNanchor_82" id="FNanchor_82"></a><a href="#Footnote_82" class="fnanchor">[82]</a>.
Suffice it to say that the Dragon was borne in the English army at
Lewes in 1216, at Creçy in 1346, and finally at Bosworth Field in 1485,
whence, in company with two banners, one containing the image of
St George and the other a Dun Cow, it was carried in state to
St Paul's Cathedral. Under all the Tudor sovereigns the Dragon
formed one of the supporters of the Royal Arms, it appeared on the
streamers of the <i>Henri Grace à Dieu</i>, and to this day it supports the
Arms of the City of London and gives a name to one of the Officers
of Arms&mdash;Rouge Dragon.</p>

<p>Before we turn aside to retrace the steps by which St George
became the patron saint of England and the red cross on white
ground England's national flag, we must first briefly notice the other
saintly banners with which, for a time, it contested the pre-eminence.
Mention has already been made of the "Standard" from which the
battle of 1138 took its name. This standard consisted of the mast of
a ship fixed on a four-wheeled frame. At the top was placed a silver
pyx containing a consecrated wafer, and beneath this were suspended
the banners of St Peter (of York), St John (of Beverley), and St Wilfred
(of Ripon). The entirely religious nature of this standard is no doubt
due to the fact that the English levies had been gathered under the
direction of Thurstan, the aged Archbishop of York<a name="FNanchor_83" id="FNanchor_83"></a><a href="#Footnote_83" class="fnanchor">[83]</a>.</p>

<p>The banner of St John of Beverley was again in evidence during
the Scottish wars of Edward I, and during these same wars there appears
for the first time the banner of another north of England saint,
St Cuthbert of Durham. Both these banners were carried by ecclesiastics,
who were paid by the king for their services. In addition to
these, which seem to have been carried only in the Northern wars,
there were in use, as appears from the Wardrobe Accounts for 1299-1300<a name="FNanchor_84" id="FNanchor_84"></a><a href="#Footnote_84" class="fnanchor">[84]</a>,
five other banners: two of the Arms of England, one of the
arms of St George, one of the arms of St Edmund, and one of the
arms of St Edward.</p>

<p>A description of the banner of St Cuthbert has been preserved
for us in a MS. of the sixteenth century<a name="FNanchor_85" id="FNanchor_85"></a><a href="#Footnote_85" class="fnanchor">[85]</a>:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>There was also a Baner ... called Sanct Cuthbertes Baner which was
five yards in length. All the pippes of it were of sylver to be sleaven on a
long speire staffe, and on the overmost pype on the hight of yt was a ffyne
lytle silver crosse, and a goodly Banner cloth perteyned to yt. And in the
mydes of the banner cloth was all of white velvett, halfe a yerd squayre
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>every way, and a faire crose of Read velvett over yt, and within ye said
white velvett was ye holy Relique, ye Corporax that ye holy man Sancte
Cuthbert did cover the chalyce withall when he sayd mess. And the
Resydewe of ye Banner clothe was all of Read velvett, imbrodered all
with grene sylke and goulde most sumtuousle.</p></div>

<p>The arms of England were at this period the three leopards (or
lions): those of St George the well-known red cross. St Edmund's
arms are believed to have been three golden crowns on a blue field<a name="FNanchor_86" id="FNanchor_86"></a><a href="#Footnote_86" class="fnanchor">[86]</a>,
those of St Edward (Edward the Confessor) were, also on a blue
field, a cross flory between five martlets, gold<a name="FNanchor_87" id="FNanchor_87"></a><a href="#Footnote_87" class="fnanchor">[87]</a>. Some of Edward's
coins show on the reverse a cross between four small birds that may
be taken to be martlets, the heraldic swallow without feet or beak.
These alone of all the saintly "arms" appear to have had any direct
connection with the man with whose name they are associated.</p>

<p>Under Henry V there was added to these a banner emblematic of
the Holy Trinity<a name="FNanchor_88" id="FNanchor_88"></a><a href="#Footnote_88" class="fnanchor">[88]</a>, which was carried at Agincourt. In addition to
these we hear of a banner of St William, carried in the Earl of Surrey's
army in the north in 1513.</p>

<p>It will have been noticed that, with the exception of the two
apostles, only one of these saints, St George, is of foreign extraction.
How did it come to pass that this foreign saint completely eclipsed
those who, in the literal sense of the word, were strictly national?</p>

<p>Few saints have been so universally honoured as St George, and
yet there is not a saint in the calendar about whose life so little that
is authentic is known. He was a soldier who attained the crown of
martyrdom during the reign of Diocletian. That is the extent of our
knowledge, and on this meagre foundation the wildest, the most incredible
legends have been embroidered. Even the date of his death
is not certain<a name="FNanchor_89" id="FNanchor_89"></a><a href="#Footnote_89" class="fnanchor">[89]</a>, yet from an early age he was one of the most popular
of saints, especially in the East, where he was revered by Mahometan
and Christian alike. And here it is to be noted that he is not the George
of Cappadocia, the Arian Bishop of Alexandria who met with the
death his acts had amply merited at the hands of the populace in
the year 361, although so eminent an authority as Gibbon<a name="FNanchor_90" id="FNanchor_90"></a><a href="#Footnote_90" class="fnanchor">[90]</a> has
declared them one and the same.</p>

<p>The cult of St George spread from East to West. In the fifth
century he was honoured in Gaul. The monastery at Thetford,
founded in the reign of Canute, was dedicated to him<a name="FNanchor_91" id="FNanchor_91"></a><a href="#Footnote_91" class="fnanchor">[91]</a>, and the
churches of St George at Fordington (now a part of Dorchester)
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>and Southwark were founded before the Norman Conquest. But
although his feast day (23rd April) had been included by the Venerable
Bede in his <cite>Martyrologium</cite> it does not appear to have been generally
observed in England till a later date. One of the payments in the
Misae roll of 14 John (1213)<a name="FNanchor_92" id="FNanchor_92"></a><a href="#Footnote_92" class="fnanchor">[92]</a> is dated as the day before the feast of
St George, and this feast was included among the minor festivals
by the Council at Oxford in 1222<a name="FNanchor_93" id="FNanchor_93"></a><a href="#Footnote_93" class="fnanchor">[93]</a>, yet it is not mentioned in the
Constitutions of the Bishop of Worcester in 1240<a name="FNanchor_94" id="FNanchor_94"></a><a href="#Footnote_94" class="fnanchor">[94]</a>. It is included in
the list of saints' days drawn up by the Synod of Exeter in 1287, but
it is not included in lists drawn up by Archbishops of Canterbury in
1332 and 1400, nor in one drawn up by the Bishop of Bath and Wells
in 1342<a name="FNanchor_95" id="FNanchor_95"></a><a href="#Footnote_95" class="fnanchor">[95]</a>.</p>

<p>The explanation of this lies in the fact that St George was not a
churchman's but a soldier's saint. It is to our crusading kings, Richard
and Edward I, and to their followers that he owes a popularity that
extends to numbers that do not reverence saints and would be hard
put to it to name offhand half a dozen others.</p>

<p>St George became especially popular among the crusaders, and
his miraculous intervention was believed to have decided victory in
their favour on several occasions. The early sculptured tympanum
over the south door of St George's Church at Fordington is supposed
to represent the saint intervening in behalf of the Christians at the
battle of Antioch in 1098. The same subject occurs in a mural painting
in the church at Hardham in Sussex<a name="FNanchor_96" id="FNanchor_96"></a><a href="#Footnote_96" class="fnanchor">[96]</a>. Both painting and sculpture
are assigned to the twelfth century. In both instances the saint is on
horseback and carries a lance; with the butt end he strikes down the
foe. Near the head of the lance is a gonfanon the fly of which is split
into long tails. No sign of the cross now remains in the painting, but
in the sculpture it is plainly visible at the head of this gonfanon. As
the earliest representation in England of St George's flag, this sculpture
is of especial interest.</p>

<p>As already remarked in the previous chapter, the date at which
the red cross on a white field first became associated with St George
is not known. Jacobus de Voragine, the thirteenth century author of
the <cite>Legenda Aurea</cite>, quotes an earlier history of Antioch as his
authority for the statement that at the Siege of Jerusalem (1099)
the Christians hesitated to ascend the scaling ladders until St George,
clad in white armour marked with the red cross, appeared and beckoned
them on.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span></p>

<p>The date at which St George's cross became accepted as the
English national flag has also yet to be ascertained. It does not appear
to have been used as such at the time of the Third Crusade. In January,
1188, when Henry II and his followers enrolled themselves in response
to the preaching of William of Tyre, they received white
crosses, while the French took red and the Flemings green ones<a name="FNanchor_97" id="FNanchor_97"></a><a href="#Footnote_97" class="fnanchor">[97]</a>. At
first sight it may seem that there is some error in this statement. We
know that at a later period the English had adopted the red cross on
white ground while the French made use of a white one on a blue
ground. Cleirac<a name="FNanchor_98" id="FNanchor_98"></a><a href="#Footnote_98" class="fnanchor">[98]</a>, writing in 1661 and knowing of no other authority
for the statement than Matthew Paris, attempted to solve this difficulty
by "restoring" the text and interchanging "red" and "white,"
but this simple expedient is not allowed to the modern student. The
statement occurs not only in Matthew Paris, who had probably taken
it from the Abbot Benedict's <cite>Gesta Regis Henrici Secundi</cite>, but also
in the works of John de Oxenedes, Bartholomew de Cotton, Roger
de Wendover and Ralph de Diceto. It is not probable that so many
contemporary, or nearly contemporary, writers would make or repeat
such a statement if it were erroneous.</p>

<p>Time and circumstances have not permitted of an absolutely
exhaustive examination of the public records, but after a lengthy
search in all likely places the author has not been able to find any
mention of the "arms" or flag of St George in English earlier than
the year 1277. In the roll of accounts<a name="FNanchor_99" id="FNanchor_99"></a><a href="#Footnote_99" class="fnanchor">[99]</a> relating to the Welsh War of
that year (the fifth of Edward I) occur payments to Admetus, the
king's tailor, for the purchase of white and coloured cloth, buckram,
etc., for the manufacture of pennoncels and bracers "of the arms of
St George." In the original these entries have all been struck through,
probably because they were accounted for elsewhere in some roll
now perished. While this account only mentions three streamers of
the king's arms, it includes the comparatively large number of 340<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
pennoncels of St George's arms. It is probable that banners of the
king's arms and of the arms of St Edward and St Edmund were also
in use, together with banners of the feudal lords taking the field, just
as we find them in use twenty-three years later at the siege of Carlaverock<a name="FNanchor_100" id="FNanchor_100"></a><a href="#Footnote_100" class="fnanchor">[100]</a>,
but it is evident from the entries above referred to that
the arms of St George were in great, if not exclusive, demand for the
smaller flags, which in some cases are expressly stated to be for the
king's foot soldiers (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">pro peditibus regis</i>).</p>

<p>We have, therefore, in determining the probable date of the
introduction of St George's cross as an English national flag to take
into account the following facts.</p>

<p>In the year 1188 the red cross was not a mark of English nationality,
although it was certainly in use in the East and by the Genoese as a
religious emblem associated with St George.</p>

<p>In 1213 the feast of St George was recognised by the Court
officials and used in dating payments, but was not yet generally
observed by the people.</p>

<p>In 1222 this feast was included among the minor festivals to be
observed in the English Church, but its omission in later lists shows
that it was not universally observed and that no special importance
was attached to it.</p>

<p>The cross of St George is definitely referred to in 1277 in circumstances
that leave no doubt that it was then in use in England as
a national emblem.</p>

<p>We must now briefly recall the state of affairs in England during
those ninety years. After Henry II assumed the cross in 1188 his
quarrel with Philip of France and with his own son prevented him
from proceeding to the Holy Land. Richard, who succeeded him in
1189, spent only six months of his ten years' reign in England. On
his return in 1194 after his long absence at the Crusades and in
captivity, he spent only two months in this country and then went
to France, where the remainder of his life was spent. The whole of
John's reign was spent in quarrels with his subjects. Henry III,
throughout his long reign of fifty-six years, took up an attitude which
was decidedly un-English. On the other hand, Edward I is generally
recognised by historians as the first king of "English" nationality.
At the date of his succession to the throne he was absent at the
Crusades, and as the country was enjoying peace at the hands of
those entrusted with the administration of the government he did
not return to England until 1274. This peace was not broken until
the attempt of Llewellyn to secure the absolute independence of
Wales brought on the Welsh War of 1277.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span></p>
<p>Having all these circumstances in view, it seems on the whole
probable that the cross of St George, although more or less familiar
to the English, was first erected by Edward I into a national symbol
for a people that, by the incorporation of the foreign elements introduced
at the Norman Conquest (assisted by the loss of the greater
part of the continental possessions of its kings) had at length become
a homogeneous nation. From the entries in the roll above referred to
and from similar entries in later rolls of Edward I it appears that the
cross of St George was almost entirely confined to the pennoncels
on the spears of the foot-soldiers and to the "bracers" which the
archers bore on their left forearms. Why the bracer should be singled
out for this distinction is not clear, but it will be remembered that
little over a hundred years later the bracer of Chaucer's "Yeoman"
was a conspicuous part of his dress.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">And in his hond he bar a mighty bowe</span>
<span class="i0"> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; * &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; * &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; * &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; * &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; *</span>
<span class="i0">Upon his arme he bar a gay bracer</span>
<span class="i0">And by his side a swerd and a bokeler<a name="FNanchor_101" id="FNanchor_101"></a><a href="#Footnote_101" class="fnanchor">[101]</a>.</span>
</div></div>

<p>We may suppose that the cross of St George, the simplest and
most conspicuous of all the saintly devices, was chosen as the distinctive
badge of all those not entitled to armorial bearings and not
clothed in the livery of the feudal lords. Indeed, from the expression
"for the King's footsoldiers" (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">pro peditibus regis</i>), which occurs in
more than one of the rolls, it would seem that the St George's cross
was used instead of the royal arms for the soldiery raised directly by
the king and not brought into the field under the banner of any of
the nobles. It is not until the reign of Richard II that we meet with
an order for the whole of the army to be ensigned with the St George's
cross.</p>

<p>Among the greater banners that of St George was not as yet
supreme; it was indeed only one of four, for when the Castle of
Carlaverock was taken in the year 1300:</p>

<div class = "group">

<p class="no-indent">Then the king caused his banner<br />

and that of the Lord of Clifford<br />
to whom the castle was entrusted.</p>
</div></div>

<p>The first step towards the promotion of St George to a position
of predominance seems to be due to Edward III, who in gratitude
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>for his supposed help at the Battle of Creçy founded the Chapel of
St George at Windsor in 1348. It is from this time that we may date
the actual dethronement of Edward the Confessor from the position
of "patron saint" of England and the definite substitution of
St George in his place. This process was completed under Henry V
after the Battle of Agincourt. A Convocation of the province of
Canterbury held at St Paul's towards the end of 1415 raised the
festival of St George to the position of a "double major feast" and
ordered it to be observed throughout the province (which includes
England and Wales south of Cheshire and Yorkshire) with as much
solemnity as Christmas Day. The Archbishop<a name="FNanchor_103" id="FNanchor_103"></a><a href="#Footnote_103" class="fnanchor">[103]</a>, in his formal communication
to the Bishop of London of the decision arrived at,
refers to St George as being "as it were the patron and special protector"
of the nation, "For by his intervention, as we unhesitatingly
believe, not only is the armed force of the English people directed
in time of war against hostile incursions, but by the help of such a
patron the struggles of the unarmed clergy<a name="FNanchor_104" id="FNanchor_104"></a><a href="#Footnote_104" class="fnanchor">[104]</a> in time of peace are
frequently strengthened<a name="FNanchor_105" id="FNanchor_105"></a><a href="#Footnote_105" class="fnanchor">[105]</a>."</p>

<p>When the Prayer Book was revised under Edward VI, the festival
of St George was abolished, with many others. Under the influence
of the Reformation the banners of his former rivals, St Edward and
St Edmund, together with all other religious flags in public use,
except that of St George, entirely disappeared, and their place was
taken by banners containing the royal badges.</p>

<p>We have seen that the appearance of the red cross on the clothing
of the soldiery can be traced back to the "bracer" of the archers of
1277. The Ordinances of War made by Richard II at Durham in
1385, when on his way to repel a threatened invasion from Scotland,
required every man in the king's army to bear a large cross of
St George on his clothing before and behind. Richard appears to
have adopted this expedient from the Scots, though they were of
course not the first people to make use of it. On the 1st of July in
that year orders had been issued for the soldiers of the Scottish army
to be marked with a white St Andrew's cross (see <a href="#Page_47">p. 47</a>). At that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>date Richard was at Westminster; he left there about the 4th of July,
was at Leicester on the 7th, and at York from the 17th to 22nd. On
the 26th he had reached Durham; he remained there till the 28th,
and arrived at Morpeth by the 31st. The ordinances which he issued
at Durham must therefore be dated at the end of July<a name="FNanchor_106" id="FNanchor_106"></a><a href="#Footnote_106" class="fnanchor">[106]</a>, and as there
is no evidence that the English were at this time in the habit of marking
their coats with the red cross before and behind, we may reasonably
infer that it was then done for the first time in direct imitation
of the Scots. This provision is also found in the similar ordinances
made by Henry V at Mantes in 1419, the only difference between
them being that while under the older orders no prisoner was allowed
to wear this cross, under the later ones prisoners in the custody of
their captors might do so.</p>

<p>There is no record of the flags flown on English ships earlier
than the thirteenth century, but there can be little doubt that in the
eleventh and twelfth centuries they were of the rudimentary form
(little more than wind vanes) depicted on the ships of the Bayeux
Tapestry. The invention of the banner of arms about the middle of
the thirteenth century provided a ready means of distinguishing the
nationality, port of origin, or ownership of a ship at sea, and its use
for that purpose is indicated in a number of seals of seaport towns
which may be dated from the latter half of that century. Thus the
seal of Lyme Regis (<a href="#PLATE_III">Plate III</a>, fig. 1), incorporated in the reign of
Edward I, shows in addition to the early type of gonfanon simply
charged with a cross, displayed from the masthead, banners of arms
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>on spears amidships, the arms being those of England and of Castile
and Leon, the latter in compliment to Eleanor of Castile, Queen of
Edward I. The seal of Sandwich (<a href="#PLATE_III">Plate III</a>, fig. 4), somewhat earlier
in design if not in actual date, shows in addition to a small pendant
at the masthead, a banner on the forecastle and two banners on the
aftercastle. The ship in the seal of Faversham (<a href="#PLATE_III">Plate III</a>, fig. 5) displays
a pendant at the masthead, the banner of St George on the
forecastle, and a banner charged with three chevronels on the aftercastle,
while the ship of Hastings (<a href="#PLATE_III">Plate III</a>, fig. 6) displays the banner
of the Cinque Ports (<a href="#PLATE_I">Plate I</a>, fig. 13) at the bow and the banner of
England on the aftercastle, in addition to a gonfanon at the masthead.
From the closing years of this century onwards a number of
documents have survived in the Public Records which give indications
of the nature of the flags displayed at sea. Thus the accounts<a name="FNanchor_109" id="FNanchor_109"></a><a href="#Footnote_109" class="fnanchor">[109]</a>
of the ship sent from Yarmouth to fetch the "Maid of Norway" in
1290 show that this ship was provided with banners of the Royal
Arms and silken streamers, and in the year 1294 sum of 5<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i>
was expended in the purchase of a streamer, and 20<i>d.</i> for a banner
containing the figure of St George, for a galley building at York,
while for one building at Southampton in the same year no less than
40<i>s</i>. (relatively a large sum) was expended in purchasing two streamers
and twenty-five banners of the Royal Arms. The most interesting
documents of that period are, however, first an ordinance made at
Bruges on 8th March, 1297, between Edward I and the Count of
Flanders<a name="FNanchor_110" id="FNanchor_110"></a><a href="#Footnote_110" class="fnanchor">[110]</a> which provided that all ships of England, Bayonne and
other places under the English crown going to Flanders should display
a banner of the Royal Arms (<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">le signal des armes du Roy d'Engleterre</i>)
and that the ships of Flanders should display the arms of the
Count and be provided with letters patent sealed with the seal of their
port of origin confirming their right to do so&mdash;probably the earliest
instance of the existence of "ships' papers" upon record. The second
document<a name="FNanchor_111" id="FNanchor_111"></a><a href="#Footnote_111" class="fnanchor">[111]</a> is a long recital of disputes at sea between the mariners
of England and Bayonne on the one side and the Normans on the
other, during the years from 1292 to 1298. From this it appears that in
a pitched battle which took place off the coast of Brittany the Normans
had flown at the mastheads streamers of red sendal 30 yards
long and 2 yards broad called "baucans," and "signifying death
without quarter and mortal war in all parts where mariners are to
be found."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span></p>

<p>When we enter upon the fourteenth century the sources of information
become more ample and the flags show greater diversity of
device. The ship in the seal of Dover of 1305 (<a href="#PLATE_III">Plate III</a>, fig. 3) displays
the banner of the Cinque Ports on the stern castle and a gonfanon
at the masthead. The accounts of the king's armourer in 1322
contain entries of eighty penoncels for galleys with the royal arms in
chief, a large number of banners of the arms of St Edmund (<a href="#PLATE_I">Plate I</a>,
fig. 7) and of the arms of St Edward (<a href="#PLATE_I">Plate I</a>, fig. 6), standards of the
royal arms, penoncels of St George for lances, and three banners of
St George, but it is not clear whether any of the above, except the
80 penoncels, were for the king's ships. The material used, in addition
to sendal, was worsted, sindon and cloth of Aylsham.</p>

<p>A roll of the expenses of John de Bukyngham, clerk of the great
wardrobe, shows the following flags to have been manufactured under
his directions for the king's ships in 1350:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>2 penoncels of sindon, 7¼ yards long and 2 cloths wide, red with a
white pale charged with 3 blue garters,</p>

<p>2 penoncels 3¼ yards long and 3 cloths wide, charged with a shield of
the royal arms surrounded by a blue garter,</p>

<p>2 streamers for the "Jerusalem," one 32 yards long and 5 cloths wide
with the royal arms in chief and striped red and white fly; the other
30 yards long, of red worsted, charged with white dragons, green lozenges
and leopards' heads,</p>

<p>2 standards for the same ship, 8 yards square,</p>

<p>A streamer for the "Marye," 32 yards long with figure of St Mary in
chief, and the royal arms quarterly in the fly,</p>

<p>A streamer for the "Edward" 33 yards long with an "E" in chief and
the royal arms in the fly,</p>

<p>Streamers for the "John," "Edmund" and several other ships with
figures of the saint appropriate to the name painted upon linen cloth in
chief,</p>

<p>3 streamers 5, 10, and 30 yards long with the royal arms in chief and
fly chequered green and white powdered with green and red roses,</p>

<p>A streamer 24 yards long and 4 cloths wide for the ship assigned to
the King's Wardrobe, charged with the royal arms, with a black key in
chief, and 6 standards for the same ship with a leopard at the head followed
by a black key and the royal arms.</p></div>

<p>A few years later we have an indenture dated in the forty-third
year of Edward III whereby John de Haytfeld, clerk of the armour
and artillery of the king's ships, acknowledges the receipt from
Thomas de Carleton, the king's armourer<a name="FNanchor_112" id="FNanchor_112"></a><a href="#Footnote_112" class="fnanchor">[112]</a>, of a number of flags of
the following types:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Streamers with the royal arms in chief varying in length from 8 to
38 yards</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
<p>Standards with the royal arms in chief varying in length from 7 to
12 yards</p>

<p>Banners of the royal arms</p>

<p>Banners of St George</p>

<p>A Gonfanon of council of red tartaryn worked with nine golden angels
supporting a shield of the royal arms, each angel having on his head a
chaplet of the Order of the Garter (<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Un gonfanon de conseil de tartaryn

<p>A gonfanon blue and white with a shield of the royal arms surrounded
by a garter powdered with a golden fleurs de lis.</p></div>

<p>A similar indenture made with John of Sleaford, Clerk of the
Privy Wardrobe, mentions 18 standards of worsted of the royal arms,
and 234 standards of linen of the arms of St George with leopards
of worsted in chief.</p>

<p>The flags of the fifteenth century were of similar type. A roll of
the tenth year of Henry V<a name="FNanchor_113" id="FNanchor_113"></a><a href="#Footnote_113" class="fnanchor">[113]</a>, containing a long list of articles supplied
for the royal ships, mentions the following flags:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
For the "Trinity Royal"<br />
<span class="pad2">A banner of council of the royal arms and St George,</span><br />
<span class="pad2">Gittons of the Holy Trinity, St Mary, St Edward, royal arms,</span><br />

<span class="pad2">Standards of St Mary, St George, the ostrich feather and royal</span><br />

<br />
For the "Grace Dieu"<br />
<span class="pad2">A streamer of St Nicholas,</span><br />
<span class="pad2">A gitton of St Edward.</span><br />
</div>

<p>This exuberance of design persisted until the Reformation in
England put the saints out of favour. While in the early years of
Henry VIII the 'Henri Grace à Dieu' was provided with banners
of England, England and Spain, Castile, Guienne, Wales, Cornwall,
the pomegranate and rose, the rose of white and green, and St Edward<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
streamers "with a dragon" 45 and 42 yards long, one with a lion
36 yards long, one with a greyhound 18 yards long and two "litell
streamers with crosse of saint George" 15 and 12 yards in length
respectively, and other ships had banners of St Peter, St Katherine,
St Edward, St Anne, the dragon, greyhound, portcullis and red lion,
towards the end of his reign the saintly flags had disappeared for ever,
except for the red cross of St George, and the royal arms and royal
badges alone remain. Thus the ship reproduced in the frontispiece
from a plan of Calais harbour<a name="FNanchor_114" id="FNanchor_114"></a><a href="#Footnote_114" class="fnanchor">[114]</a> made about the year 1545 displays,
in addition to the huge streamer of St George, only the royal arms
and the royal badges of the fleur-de-lis and crown, ostrich feather,
portcullis and crown, and rose and crown.</p>

<p>The rolls of Anthony Anthony, prepared in the last year of
Henry VIII, show streamers party green and white (the Tudor
colours) with St George's cross in chief; banners of St George and
of the Tudor colours in horizontal stripes, and a few banners of the
royal arms, and of the fleur-de-lis badge.</p>

<p>The accounts for the year 1574, when ensigns appear for the first
time among sea stores, give the following details as to their construction.
There were twenty-four of them made "for her Ma<sup>ts</sup> newe
shippes," the material being "bolonia sarcenett of diverse coulors."
Staves were provided, one with a gilt and the others with steel heads,
with a pair of tassels to each. The flags were provided with canvas
sockets. For the banners red and blue say was provided, with buckram
for the socket, and "mockadoe fringe." Streamers and banners were
primed, painted and coloured in oil colours by Wm Herne, the
queen's serjeant painter, and the streamers were of the following
lengths:</p>

<div class="cen2">
84 feet long and 9 feet broad at the head<br />
60 &nbsp; &nbsp; " &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; " &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 7 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;" &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;" &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"<br />
54 &nbsp; &nbsp; " &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; " &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 8 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;" &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;" &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"<br />
45 &nbsp; &nbsp; " &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; " &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 6 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;" &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;" &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"<br />
36 &nbsp; &nbsp; " &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; " &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 6 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;" &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;" &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"<br />
</div>

<p>There were besides four banners of fine linen cloth, fringed, and
quartered with the royal arms, each being 15 feet long and 13 feet
6 inches deep. "And more twoe banners of damask thone of crymson
with a lyon of gold, thother of purple with affaulcon of silver
fringed with silke."</p>

<p>When Drake and Hawkins set out for their last voyage in 1594
they were provided with</p>

<div class="blockquot">
4 flags gilt with her Majesty's arms costing 60<i>s.</i> each<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>30 flags of St George costing 16<i>s.</i> and 8<i>d.</i> a piece<br />
3 streamers with the Queen's badges in silver and gold that cost £8 each.<br />
80 other streamers costing 25<i>s</i>. each, and<br />
26 ensigns;<br />
</div>

<p class="no-indent">the total cost of these flags reaching the large amount (for those days)
of £221.</p>

<p>Very little record remains of the flags flown by British merchant
ships during this period. It has been already remarked that those
going to Flanders at the end of the thirteenth century were ordered
to fly the royal arms, and banners of these arms appear on the ships
in the early seals of Lyme Regis, Hastings and Bristol. The fifteenth
century seal of Yarmouth (<a href="#PLATE_III">Plate III</a>, fig. 2) shows the banner of
St George on the forecastle, a pendant with cross of St George in
chief at the masthead, and a banner of the arms of Yarmouth<a name="FNanchor_115" id="FNanchor_115"></a><a href="#Footnote_115" class="fnanchor">[115]</a> (closely
resembling the Cinque Ports flag but with herrings' tails substituted
for the dimidiated hulks) upon the stern castle. In the seal of Tenterden
(<a href="#PLATE_III">Plate III</a>, fig. 7) and of Rye, also of the fifteenth century, the
banner of St George is prominent. It seems probable that from the
fourteenth century onwards ships not belonging to the king or the
nobility flew the flag of St George when they flew any flag at all. In
ships belonging to the greater nobles the custom appears to have
been to display a streamer of the owner's badges; thus the ships in
the "Warwick Pageant<a name="FNanchor_116" id="FNanchor_116"></a><a href="#Footnote_116" class="fnanchor">[116]</a>," drawn circa 1490, display streamers containing
the badges of the bear and ragged staff with St George's
cross in chief. Ships of lesser owners, belonging to an important
seaport such as the Cinque Ports or Yarmouth, appear to have flown
the recognised flag of that port in addition to a flag or streamer of
St George.</p>

<p>By the end of the sixteenth century the use of the royal arms had
become confined to the Admiral of the Fleet; the royal badges had
nearly disappeared from the sea, though they are occasionally to be
met with during the next century, and the flag of St George had
taken the lead as the distinguishing characteristic of English ships,
both men-of-war and merchantmen.</p>

<p>The history of the national flags of Scotland is much less complicated
than that of the flags of England, for the northern nation
had decided upon their patron saint at a much earlier date than their
neighbours south of the Tweed. There was a similar struggle for supremacy
among competing saints, but the issue was decided in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>eighth century and appears to have remained unchallenged ever
since. In the words of Wm Forbes Skene, the Scottish historian,</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>With the departure of the Columban Clergy, the veneration of
St Columba as the apostle of the northern Picts seems to have been given
up, at least by the southern portion of that people, and St Peter now
became the patron saint of the kingdom and continued to be so till the
year 736, when Angus the son of Fergus established his power by the
defeat of Nectan himself, and the other competitors for the throne. As
the king rapidly brought the territories of the other Pictish families under
his sway, and even added Dalriada to his kingdom, he seemed desirous to
connect a new ecclesiastical influence with his reign, for in the same year
that he completed the conquest of Dalriada he founded a church at
St Andrews, in which he placed a new body of clergy, who had brought
the relics of St Andrew with them, and this apostle soon became the more
popular patron saint of the kingdom, while the previous patronage of
St Peter disappeared from the annals<a name="FNanchor_117" id="FNanchor_117"></a><a href="#Footnote_117" class="fnanchor">[117]</a>.</p></div>

<p>It is probable that the cross-saltire was adopted by the Scots as
a national ensign at a very early period, but there seems no direct
evidence of this before the fourteenth century. The earliest Scottish
records were unfortunately lost at sea in the ship that was sent to
return them to that country, whence they had been carried off, with
the Stone of Destiny, by Edward I.</p>

<p>In the summer of the year 1385 the Scots planned a raid into
England, in which they were assisted by a considerable contingent
of French. The Ordinances for the allied army drawn up by the
Council for this occasion and promulgated on the 1st July contained
the following proviso:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Item every man French and Scots shall have a sign before and behind,
namely a white St Andrew's Cross, and if his jack is white or his coat
white he shall bear the said white cross in a piece of black cloth round or
square<a name="FNanchor_118" id="FNanchor_118"></a><a href="#Footnote_118" class="fnanchor">[118]</a>.</p></div>

<p>It will be noted that the field on which the cross-saltire was to be
placed was immaterial, but if the coat happened to be white the
field was to be black. There is other evidence that the ground colour
was not an essential part of the design, although the prevailing colour
at a later date seems to have been blue. In the Accounts of the Lord
High Treasurer of Scotland<a name="FNanchor_119" id="FNanchor_119"></a><a href="#Footnote_119" class="fnanchor">[119]</a> for the year 1512 there is recorded a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>payment for a roll of blue say for the banner of a ship "with Sanct
Androis cors in the myddis." In 1513 the ground colour was also
blue. In 1523, however, when orders were again issued for each man
to bear the white saltire before and behind, no ground was mentioned,
while in 1540 and 1542 the ground colour of the ensigns was
yellow and red (the Stuart livery colours) or red, as the following
entries show:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

</div>

<p>There is a similar entry on the 12th for 8 ells red, and 2½ ells
white for the cross.</p>

<p>Cleirac, in his <cite>Explication des Termes de Marine, etc.</cite><a name="FNanchor_124" id="FNanchor_124"></a><a href="#Footnote_124" class="fnanchor">[124]</a>, gives for
the Scotch flag a ground of red or blue, and also a ground of red,
yellow and green, with the saltire in a canton or overall<a name="FNanchor_125" id="FNanchor_125"></a><a href="#Footnote_125" class="fnanchor">[125]</a>. It is probable,
however, that he was relying on obsolete information, for there seems
no other evidence of a parti-coloured field so late as 1670<a name="FNanchor_126" id="FNanchor_126"></a><a href="#Footnote_126" class="fnanchor">[126]</a>, though
a red ensign for ships, with white saltire in a blue canton<a name="FNanchor_127" id="FNanchor_127"></a><a href="#Footnote_127" class="fnanchor">[127]</a>, was in use
until the Legislative Union of 1707.</p>

<p>It remains to say a few words about the royal banner, which may
be considered in a sense national although it is the personal heraldic
flag of the sovereign and ought not to be used by any subject. The
rampant lion with a tressure fleur-de-lisé first appears in a seal of
Alexander II appended to a Charter dated 1222<a name="FNanchor_128" id="FNanchor_128"></a><a href="#Footnote_128" class="fnanchor">[128]</a>. Except for the
period during which Mary Queen of Scots, after her marriage with
the Dauphin, impaled the French Arms with her own it has remained
unaltered, in the form in which we now see it quartered in the Royal
Standard, since the thirteenth century.</p>

<p>The Raven and the Dragon Standards found their way into Scotland,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>but are not met with after the twelfth century. In the early
years of the eleventh century Sigurd, Earl of Orkney, who afterwards
carried the Raven standard against the Irish at Clontarf, was challenged
by Finleic, Earl of the Scots, to battle at Skedmire.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Sigrod sought his mother that she might divine unto him upon the
matter, for she was a wise woman. The earl told her that the odds in number
between his foeman and his own men would not be less than seven to one.
She answered, "I would have brought thee up all thy life in my wool-basket,
if I had known that thou wert bent upon living for ever; but 'tis
Fate that settles a man's days whatever he is. It is better to die with honour
than to live with shame. Now take this banner, which I have wrought for
thee with all my skill! And I say, by my knowledge, that the victory shall
be to them before whom it is borne, but deadly shall it be to them that
bear it." The banner was made with much fine needle-work, and with
exceeding art. It was wrought in the likeness of a raven, and when the
wind blew upon the banner it was as if the raven flapped his wings in
flight. Earl Sigrod was very angry at his mother's words; and gave the
Orkneymen their ethel-holdings free to raise a levy for him; and went to
Skedmire to meet Earl Finleic, and each of them set his host in array.
And as soon as the battle was joined, Earl Sigrod's standard-bearer was
shot to death. The Earl called upon another man to carry the standard,
and he bore it for a short while and then fell also. Three of the Earl's
standard-bearers fell indeed, but he won the victory<a name="FNanchor_129" id="FNanchor_129"></a><a href="#Footnote_129" class="fnanchor">[129]</a>.</p></div>

<p>The Dragon appeared as the Scottish Royal Standard at the
Battle of the Standard (1138). According to the contemporary "Relatio
de Standardo<a name="FNanchor_130" id="FNanchor_130"></a><a href="#Footnote_130" class="fnanchor">[130]</a>," written by St Aelred, Abbot of Rielvaulx
Abbey in Yorkshire, when the Scots broke and fled those in flight
saw from the position of the royal standard, which was in the likeness
of a dragon<a name="FNanchor_131" id="FNanchor_131"></a><a href="#Footnote_131" class="fnanchor">[131]</a>, that their king was not slain, and gathering themselves
to him they renewed the fight. On this occasion the Scottish king's
son made use of the following ruse. Finding himself cut off with a
few companions, he told them to throw away the banners by which
they were to be recognised from the English and then, mixing with
the latter as though fighting on their side, they reached his father in
safety.</p>

<p>Except for a short period during the reign of James IV (1473-1513)
a Scots navy was either non-existent or of little importance,
and it is therefore not to be expected that any great development took
place in its flags; nevertheless, from the Lord High Treasurer's
accounts it appears that no less a sum than £72. 7<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> was expended
upon the "mayn standert" of the "Great Michael" in 1513. This flag
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>appears to have had a St Andrew's cross on a blue ground at the head,
and a fly of red and yellow on which the royal badges of the red lion
and white unicorn appeared. Other flags of this period were the
banners of St Andrew and St Margaret, and a banner and standards
with the red lion upon a yellow field.</p>

<h4><a name="Chapter_IIc" id="Chapter_IIc"></a><a href="#CONTENTS">(iii) IRELAND</a></h4>

<p>In St Patrick the Irish possess a patron saint who is in the truest
sense national. Although a native of Scotland, the best of his life and
work was devoted to the people among whom in early youth the
fortune of war placed him. He seems, moreover, never to have had
a serious competitor for their favour<a name="FNanchor_132" id="FNanchor_132"></a><a href="#Footnote_132" class="fnanchor">[132]</a>, and they have been unwavering
in their allegiance to him. Nevertheless, there is no ancient flag,
and no symbol except the shamrock, associated with his name.</p>

<p>Flags do not seem to have been in use at a very early period among
the celtic nations, and when we meet with them in Irish literature in
the eleventh century the terms used for them are not native Irish
words but had apparently been borrowed from the Danish invaders
who wrought such havoc to the ancient Irish civilisation from the
ninth to the eleventh centuries. The word used by the author of the
<cite>Cogadh Gaedhel re Gallaibh</cite> is "mergi<a name="FNanchor_133" id="FNanchor_133"></a><a href="#Footnote_133" class="fnanchor">[133]</a>," which is believed to be
borrowed from the Scandinavian "merke" (mark), while the other
word met with, "confingi," seems to be derived from the Norse
"gunfana."</p>

<p>At the great battle of Clontarf fought in the year 1014 between
the Irish under their king Brian Borumha and the Danish invaders of
Ireland under the Earl Sigurd, assisted by the revolted king of
Leinster, the Irish under Brian had many banners, but these banners
were known by their colours rather than by any particular device in
them.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Brian looked out behind him and beheld the battle phalanx ... and three
score and ten banners over them, of red, and of yellow, and of green, and
of all kinds of colours; together with the everlasting, variegated, lucky,
fortunate banner that had gained the victory in every battle and in every
conflict, and in every combat ... namely the gold-spangled banner of Fergal
Ua Ruairc<a name="FNanchor_134" id="FNanchor_134"></a><a href="#Footnote_134" class="fnanchor">[134]</a>.</p></div>

<p>These banners appear to have been personal to the chiefs and to
have been taken down when they were slain, even if their forces still
remained undefeated. During the conflict Brian, who on account of
his age took no part in the battle and was engaged in prayer at a little
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>distance, enquired repeatedly of his attendant whether the banner of
his eldest son, Murchadh, still remained aloft. Towards the end he
asked once more, and the attendant reported that it was far from
Murchadh but still standing. Brian said "The men of Erinn shall be
well while that banner remains standing because their courage and
valour shall remain in them all, as long as they can see that banner."
At length Murchadh was mortally wounded, and although the enemy
were defeated his banner was taken down. When his father asked
again, the attendant answered, "... the foreigners are now defeated
and Murchadh's banner has fallen." "That is sad news," said Brian,
"... the honour and valour of Erinn fell when that banner fell and
Erinn has fallen now indeed."</p>

<p>It may be concluded from this narrative that the Irish of the
eleventh century had no national flag common to the whole people.
This, together with the fact that after the death of Brian no Irish
king arose great enough to secure the allegiance of the whole nation,
may explain why the Irish never developed a national flag as did the
English and Scots.</p>

<p>The red saltire on white ground which represents Ireland in the
Union flag had only an ephemeral existence as a separate flag.
Originating as the arms of the powerful Geraldines, who from the
time of Henry II held the predominant position among those whose
presence in Ireland was due to the efforts of the English sovereigns
to subjugate that country, it is not to be expected that the native
Irish should ever have taken kindly to a badge that could only remind
them of their servitude to a race with whom they had little in common,
and the attempt to father this emblem upon St Patrick (who, it may
be remarked, is not entitled to a cross&mdash;since he was not a martyr)
has evoked no response from the Irish themselves.</p>

<p>The earliest evidence of the existence of the red saltire flag<a name="FNanchor_135" id="FNanchor_135"></a><a href="#Footnote_135" class="fnanchor">[135]</a> known
to the author occurs in a map of "Hirlandia" by John Goghe dated
1567 and now exhibited in the museum of the Public Record Office.
The arms at the head of this map are the St George's cross impaled
with the crowned harp, but the red saltire is prominent in the arms
of the Earl of Kildare and the other Geraldine families placed over
their respective spheres of influence. The red saltire flag is flown at
the masthead of a ship, possibly an Irish pirate, which is engaged
in action in the St George's Channel with another ship flying the
St George's cross. The St George's flag flies upon Cornwall, Wales
and Man, but the red saltire flag does not appear upon Ireland itself,
though it is placed upon the adjacent Mulls of Galloway and Kintyre
in Scotland. It is, however, to be found in the arms of Trinity College,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
Dublin (1591), in which the banners of St George and of this saltire
surmount the turrets that flank the castle gateway.</p>

<p>The Graydon MS. Flag Book of 1686 which belonged to Pepys
does not contain this flag, but gives as the flag of Ireland (which, it
may be noted, appears as an afterthought right at the end of the book)
the green flag with St George's cross and the harp, illustrated in
<a href="#PLATE_X">Plate X</a>, fig. 3. The saltire flag is nevertheless given as "Pavillon
d'Ierne" in the flag plates at the commencement of the <cite>Neptune
François</cite> of 1693, whence it was copied into later flag collections.</p>

<p>Under the Commonwealth and Protectorate, when England and
Scotland were represented in the Great and other Seals by their
crosses, Ireland was invariably represented by the harp, and in the
Union flag of 1658, as will be seen later, it was the harp that was added
to the English and Scottish crosses to form a flag representative of
the three kingdoms. At the funeral of Cromwell the Great Standards
of England and Scotland had the St George's and St Andrew's
crosses in chief respectively, but the Great Standard of Ireland had
in chief a red cross (not saltire) on a yellow field<a name="FNanchor_136" id="FNanchor_136"></a><a href="#Footnote_136" class="fnanchor">[136]</a>.</p>

<p>When the Order of St Patrick was instituted in 1783 the red
saltire was taken for the badge of the Order, and since this emblem
was of convenient form for introduction into the Union flag of
England and Scotland it was chosen in forming the combined flag
of England, Scotland and Ireland in 1801.</p>

<p>Ireland has been represented in the royal standard since 1603
by the golden harp on a blue field, but it would seem that this is not
the original arms of that country, for the augmentation of arms
granted by Richard II to his favourite Robert de Vere, Earl of Oxford,
whom he created Duke of Ireland in 1386, was <em>azure</em>, three crowns,
<em>or</em>, and these are said to have been confirmed as the true arms of
Ireland by a commission of enquiry under Edward IV. The harp,
which appears to have been an ancient badge of Ireland, was formally
adopted as the arms of that country by Henry VIII in the year when
he changed the royal style from "Dominus Hiberniae" to "Rex
Hiberniae." The change in the colour of the field from blue to green,
as is commonly seen in the flags of Irishmen in rebellion against
English rule, is believed to have originated with Owen Roe O'Neill
in 1642.</p>

<p>There is very little information as to the flags flown in Irish ships.
From a date at least as early as the thirteenth century certain of the
Irish ports were accustomed to supply ships for the king's service<a name="FNanchor_137" id="FNanchor_137"></a><a href="#Footnote_137" class="fnanchor">[137]</a>.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>Such ships would have flown the English or Cinque Ports flag. There
is indeed a mention in the State Papers of 1586<a name="FNanchor_138" id="FNanchor_138"></a><a href="#Footnote_138" class="fnanchor">[138]</a> of an Irish ship
attacking an English merchantman under the Scots flag, "showing
forth a Skottish ensigne," and a passage in Dudley's voyage in 1594<a name="FNanchor_139" id="FNanchor_139"></a><a href="#Footnote_139" class="fnanchor">[139]</a>
from which it may be inferred that there was no recognised Irish
flag at that date. In Feb. 1785, a brig from Dublin hoisted at Antigua
a green ensign with the harp and crown in the centre, which was
seized by Collingwood's orders, and later in the same year another
ship from Belfast, flying a similar ensign, was detained until the
master had gone ashore and bought proper colours for the vessel<a name="FNanchor_140" id="FNanchor_140"></a><a href="#Footnote_140" class="fnanchor">[140]</a>.</p>

 There is a smaller figure of a man in the act of striking with a club on the
downs near Cerne Abbas in Dorset. Possibly both these figures are pre-Saxon.
The horse, a favourite subject for treatment in this manner, is almost certainly
pre-Saxon; yet it was adopted by the Saxons of Kent.</p></div>

 E.g. Nicholas quotes an example in 1233, when the inhabitants of Dublin
were directed to prepare their new great galley for the king's service, and ships
from Waterford, Dublin, Youghal, Ross and Drogheda were supplied for the
Flanders expedition in 1304. Some, perhaps all, of these ports were affiliated to
the Cinque Ports, as, for instance, Youghal, which became "one of the Petylymmes
of the Cinque Ports in Ireland" in 1462. (<cite>Cal. Pat. Rolls.</cite>)</p></div>

 It may be pointed out, however, that under the present Merchant Shipping
Act the flying of such a flag, if it did not imitate the British or other national colours,
would not be illegal, but the ship must show the red ensign when required under
Art. 74 of that Act.</p></div></div>

<h3><i>The Union Flags and Jacks</i></h3>

<p class="drop-cap2"><span class="smcap">In</span> the preceding sketch of the early history of the British flags we
have, so far as evidence is available, followed the steps by which
the red cross on a white ground came to represent the people of
England, and we have seen, though less clearly, how the white saltire
on a blue ground became the chosen flag of the Scottish nation. It
now remains to trace the process by which these two flags became
united in one, and finally, by the addition of a red saltire to represent
Ireland, developed into the present Union flag.</p>

<p>On the death of Queen Elizabeth in March, 1603, the succession
to the crown lay open.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>There had been no repeal of the stipulation made by Henry VIII,
both in Act of Parliament and in his will, that after the death without
heirs of his three children, Edward, Mary and Elizabeth, the crown should
descend to the heirs of his younger sister, Mary.... Consequently, the rightful
heir when Elizabeth lay dying was no scion of the Scottish House, but
the eldest representative of the Suffolk line&mdash;Princess Mary's great-grandson,
Edward Seymour, Lord Beauchamp. But Elizabeth's ministers
were not the slaves of legal niceties. The Queen's neutrality left their
choice unfettered; and though expectation of personal profit largely moved
them, their action proved politic. Lord Beauchamp was a man of insignificant
position and character; James VI, however contemptible in
many respects, had experience as a ruler, and a contiguous kingdom to
add to the endowments of the English Crown<a name="FNanchor_141" id="FNanchor_141"></a><a href="#Footnote_141" class="fnanchor">[141]</a>.</p></div>

<p class="p2" />
<p>But the union of crowns brought about by Elizabeth's ministers
with the tacit approval of the two nations did not directly lead to
the union of peoples. The Parliaments remained separate; national
jealousies ran high, especially in England, and James was foiled in
his efforts to bring about the closer union he sought. Nevertheless,
he was determined<a name="FNanchor_142" id="FNanchor_142"></a><a href="#Footnote_142" class="fnanchor">[142]</a> that the union of the two nations should have
some other outward expression than the change in the royal standard,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>and in the beginning of the fourth year of his reign he issued a proclamation
in the following words:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="center1">A Proclamation declaring what Flags South and North
Britains shall bear at Sea.</p>

<p>Whereas some difference has arisen between our Subjects of South
and North Britain, Travelling by Sea, about the bearing of their flags,
for the avoiding of all such contentions hereafter, We have with the advice
of our Council ordered That from henceforth all our subjects of this Isle
and Kingdom of Great Britain and the Members thereof shall bear in
their maintop the Red Cross, commonly called St George's Cross, and the
White Cross, commonly called St Andrew's Cross, joined together, according
to a form made by our Heralds and sent by Us to our Admiral to be
published to our said Subjects<a name="FNanchor_143" id="FNanchor_143"></a><a href="#Footnote_143" class="fnanchor">[143]</a>. And in their foretop Our Subjects of
South Britain shall wear the Red Cross only as they were wont, and our
Subjects of North Britain in their Foretop the White Cross only as they
were accustomed. Wherefore We will and command all our Subjects to
be conformable and obedient to this Our Order, and that from henceforth
they do not use to bear their flags in any other Sort, as they will answer
the contrary at their Peril.</p>

<div class="m-right">
<p class="no-indent">Given at our Palace of Westminster the 12th.
day of April in the 4th. year of our Reign of

</div>

<p>Unfortunately the naval records of the early years of the seventeenth
century have almost entirely disappeared from the State
archives; the "State Papers" themselves are but fragmentary remains;
and the English Privy Council Registers from 1602 to 1613
were destroyed by the fire at Whitehall in 1618, so that it is impossible
to say what were the points of contention referred to in the Proclamation.</p>

<p>The birth of the flag that is now the pride of so many millions
was indeed obscure. Intended at first for use only at sea, it appears
to have excited no attention except from those directly concerned
with shipping. The royal and merchant navies were alike dwindling
away, and the sea did not fill that place in the minds of James' subjects
that it had filled in the greater days of Elizabeth.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span></p>
<p>The only strictly contemporary evidence of the actual design
chosen in 1606 is to be found in the following appeal from the shipmasters
of Scotland, whom it did not by any means please.</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="right">Edinburgh &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br />

<p>There is nothing to show that this appeal met with any response,
but the Scots never took kindly to the new flag and rarely used it until
after the Legislative Union of 1707. Sir Edward Nicholas in 1634
was doubtful "whether the Scots have used to carry that Flag of the
Union."</p>

<p>It is unfortunate that these "drafts and patterns" have disappeared,
perhaps in the same fire that consumed the "form" made
by the heralds. There is no doubt about the main outline, but the
absence of precise detail has led several writers&mdash;purists in heraldic
matters&mdash;to contend that the white border of the red cross was
simply a narrow fimbriation<a name="FNanchor_145" id="FNanchor_145"></a><a href="#Footnote_145" class="fnanchor">[145]</a>. I think, however, that examination of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>the available evidence will show that this border did not originate
as a mere "fimbriation," that it was in fact part of the field of the
English flag, and that the new flag was, as described by Sir James
Balfour<a name="FNanchor_146" id="FNanchor_146"></a><a href="#Footnote_146" class="fnanchor">[146]</a>, "the flagis of St Andrew and St George interlaced,"
not merely the red cross surmounting the Scots flag. Material
proof that it was so regarded sixty years later is in existence in
Amsterdam in the shape of actual flags captured during the Second
and Third Dutch Wars, and belonging therefore to the second half
of the seventeenth century. These show a very wide border to the
red cross, and in two instances<a name="FNanchor_147" id="FNanchor_147"></a><a href="#Footnote_147" class="fnanchor">[147]</a> the red cross, the white border and
the white saltire are each of the same width.</p>

<p>The heralds had been faced by a dilemma. It was impossible to
combine the two flags so as to form a new one without giving precedence
to one of them. If quartered, the upper canton next the staff
was the place of honour, and both could not occupy it at the same
time. In the reign of James II this difficulty was solved, in the case
of the Royal Arms, by placing the Scots' Lion in the first quarter in
the Great Seal of Scotland. Possibly a similar solution was suggested
by the Scottish shipmasters. But there was a precedent for a closer
union than this quartered form, which no doubt the heralds had in
mind. Elizabeth had granted the Levant Company, by her charters
of 1581 and 1592, the right to wear as a flag "the Armes of England
with the redde crosse in white over the same<a name="FNanchor_148" id="FNanchor_148"></a><a href="#Footnote_148" class="fnanchor">[148]</a>." We may be quite
sure that in consenting to such an arrangement Elizabeth had no
thought of giving the national flag precedence over the royal standard,
but merely wished to signify their intimate union and the extension
of the royal protection to the company. The method adopted in 1606
was exactly the same, the "red cross in white" being placed over the
Scots flag.</p>

<p>The quarterly arrangement of the crosses appears to have been
used on one occasion; the dispatch of a fleet in 1623 to bring back
Prince Charles and the Duke of Buckingham from Spain. Mr Serjeant
Knight, in a "discourse" on the St George's flag written in 1678 at
the request of Pepys<a name="FNanchor_149" id="FNanchor_149"></a><a href="#Footnote_149" class="fnanchor">[149]</a>, stated that he had in his possession the Order
from the Great Wardrobe directed to his father, Mr Thomas Knight,
Arms Painter, who was to paint the banners and streamers required
for the Prince. The principal flag was to be that shown in <a href="#PLATE_V">Plate V</a>,
fig. 1: "Imprimis in ye Prince's ship wherein he goes, on ye top ye
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>Crosses of St. Andrew and St. George." Mr Knight assured Pepys
that he could not be mistaken about this "cobled Banner," as he
scornfully called it, "ye severall arms being trickt in ye margin of
ye Order," and he proceeded to give a sketch of it. Indeed, he
was disposed to believe this to be the original form of the Union
flag:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="no-indent">having seen severall Flaggs with St. George and St. Andrew quarterly and
may every Lord Mayor's Day be seen born by some of ye Companies
Barges, these flags being made much about that time, all men being willing
to flatter their new king.</p></div>

<p class="no-indent">The evidence of the Privy Council Register of Scotland is, however,
sufficient to prove that this inference was incorrect.</p>

<p>The documents of 1606 do not give any name to the flag they
describe. It appears first to have been called the "Britain" or
"British" flag<a name="FNanchor_150" id="FNanchor_150"></a><a href="#Footnote_150" class="fnanchor">[150]</a>, and I have not found the name "Union" earlier
than 1625, when it appears in the list of the flags and banners used
at the funeral of James I<a name="FNanchor_151" id="FNanchor_151"></a><a href="#Footnote_151" class="fnanchor">[151]</a>. Three years later it appears in the Sailing
Instructions of the Earl of Lindsey<a name="FNanchor_152" id="FNanchor_152"></a><a href="#Footnote_152" class="fnanchor">[152]</a>, but the older name still persisted
at sea and is found in inventories of stores and in sailing and fighting
instructions until 1639<a name="FNanchor_153" id="FNanchor_153"></a><a href="#Footnote_153" class="fnanchor">[153]</a>.</p>

<p>Hitherto this "British" or "Union" flag had, like the old English
flag of St George, been flown equally by merchantman and man-of-war,
strangers being expected to distinguish the latter by their more
warlike appearance.</p>

<p class="p2" />
<p>Towards the year 1633, however, the old question of the salute
in the Narrow Seas was becoming more and more acute, "because,"
in the words of Sir Wm Monson, "both the French and Hollanders
seek to usurp upon his Majesties right<a name="FNanchor_154" id="FNanchor_154"></a><a href="#Footnote_154" class="fnanchor">[154]</a>." Sir John Pennington, the
"Admiral of the Narrow Seas," seized on this as an excuse to advocate
a difference in the flags of the king's and the merchants' ships. In a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>letter dated 7th April, 1634, asking for instructions on various points
relative to his duties as Admiral of the Narrow Seas he writes:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>For alteringe of the Coulers whereby his Ma<sup>ts</sup> owne Shippes may be
knowne from his Subiects I leave to yo<sup>r</sup> Lo<sup>pps</sup> more deepe consideration.
But under correction I conceive it to bee very materyall and much for his
Ma<sup>ts</sup> Hono<sup>r</sup>, and besides will free disputes with Strangers, for when they
omitt doinge their Respectes to <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;original text: his Mats Shippes">his Ma<sup>ts</sup> Shippes</ins> till they bee shott at
they alleadge they did not know it to be the kinges Shippe<a name="FNanchor_155" id="FNanchor_155"></a><a href="#Footnote_155" class="fnanchor">[155]</a>.</p>
</div>

<p>The plea that the existing arrangement caused confusion in the
minds of foreigners was quite justified, but it is probable that there
was a deeper underlying cause, jealousy of the mercantile marine.
Be this as it may, Pennington's suggestion was favourably received,
and the approval of the king was obtained to the issue of the following
Proclamation:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="center">A Proclamation appointing the Flags, as well for our Navie Royall as
for the Ships of our Subjects of South and North Britaine.</p>

<p>Wee taking into Our Royall consideration that it is meete for the
Honour of Our owne Ships in Our Navie Royall and of such other Ships
as are or shall be employed in Our immediate Service, that the same bee
by their Flags distinguished from the ships of any other of Our Subjects,
doe hereby straitly prohibite and forbid that none of Our Subjects, of any
of Our Nations and Kingdomes, shall from hencefoorth presume to carry
the Union Flagge in the Maine toppe, or other part of any of their Ships
(that is) S. Georges Crosse and S. Andrews Crosse joyned together upon
paine of Our high displeasure, but that the same Union Flagge bee still
reserved as an ornament proper for Our owne Ships and Ships in Our
immediate Service and Pay, and none other.</p>

<p>And likewise Our further will and pleasure is, that all the other Ships
of Our Subjects of England or South Britaine bearing flags shall from
hencefoorth carry the Red-Crosse, commonly called S. George his Crosse,
as of olde time hath beene used; And also that all the other ships of Our
Subjects of Scotland or North Britaine shall from hencefoorth carry the
White Crosse commonly called S. Andrews Crosse, Whereby the severall
Shipping may thereby bee distinguished and We thereby the better discerne
the number and goodnesse of the same. Wherefore Wee will and
straitly command all Our Subjects foorthwith to bee conformable and
obedient to this Our Order, as they will answer the contrary at their
perills.</p>

<div class="m-right">
<p class="no-indent">Given at Our Court at Greenwich this fifth
day of May in the tenth yeere of Our Reigne
of England Scotland France and Ireland, Defender
of the Faith &amp;c.
</p></div>
</div>

<p>The ostensible reason for this distinction in flags&mdash;to enable the
"number and goodnesse" of the ships of the two nations to be more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
readily discerned&mdash;is obviously an afterthought<a name="FNanchor_156" id="FNanchor_156"></a><a href="#Footnote_156" class="fnanchor">[156]</a>; a sugar coating to
the pill. The customs officers of the various ports could, of course,
have provided any information desired relative to the shipping, and
were not dependent on the flags for their knowledge of the ships'
nationalities. The point is of some interest as it marks a distinct step
in the exaltation of the Navy Royal and its officers into a position of
superiority over the mercantile marine.</p>

<p>It will also be observed that the proclamation of 1634 does not
require the flags to be hoisted at the masthead as did that of 1606.
Probably this was no accidental omission but was the outcome of the
general introduction of the "Jack" on the bowsprit a year or two
before. Flags had no doubt been occasionally carried on the bowsprit
from the time when that spar was first invented, but the practice had
been exceptional, at any rate in the English navy. An early instance
was depicted in a contemporary picture in Cowdray Castle, since
destroyed by fire, which represented "the encampment of the English
forces near Portsmouth, together with a view of the English and
French fleets at the commencement of the action between them on
the 19th of July, 1545." In this picture, which fortunately was reproduced
in an engraving by the Society of Antiquaries in 1780, the
Lord Admiral's ship, the 'Henri Grace à Dieu,' was seen flying a
royal standard on the bowsprit. Drake, also, had flown a striped flag
in this position in that last voyage which ended for him in his death
at sea in January, 1596<a name="FNanchor_157" id="FNanchor_157"></a><a href="#Footnote_157" class="fnanchor">[157]</a>. Yet when Captain Young submitted his
"Noates for Sea Service" to the Earl of Essex<a name="FNanchor_158" id="FNanchor_158"></a><a href="#Footnote_158" class="fnanchor">[158]</a> he wrote as though
the idea were unusual:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="no-indent">and that the cullers maye bee the better knowne from those of the
enemies and yf they chance to have the like it shalbe then convenient that
upon o<sup>r</sup> misson flagge-staves or th ende of o<sup>r</sup> bowlesprits and that theare
bee but a smawle litle flagge with a red Crosse yt being but a litle bigger
than a vaine of a great Catche<a name="FNanchor_159" id="FNanchor_159"></a><a href="#Footnote_159" class="fnanchor">[159]</a>.</p></div>

<p class="no-indent">As remarked by Admiral Sir Massie Blomfield<a name="FNanchor_160" id="FNanchor_160"></a><a href="#Footnote_160" class="fnanchor">[160]</a>, this "jack" is not
shown in the "illustrations of the flagships of the Expedition of 1596
reproduced in the 'Naval Miscellany,'<a name="FNanchor_161" id="FNanchor_161"></a><a href="#Footnote_161" class="fnanchor">[161]</a>" so that the suggestion was
probably not received with favour.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span></p>

<p>There is no mention of, or provision for, "jacks" in the inventories
which accompanied the report of the committee that inquired
into the state of the navy in 1618. Sir Julian Corbett has pointed
out<a name="FNanchor_162" id="FNanchor_162"></a><a href="#Footnote_162" class="fnanchor">[162]</a> that the earliest instance of the use of the word "jack" to denote
a flag occurs in the orders issued by Sir John Pennington to one of
his captains on 3rd July, 1633. The original has not survived, but
the copy<a name="FNanchor_163" id="FNanchor_163"></a><a href="#Footnote_163" class="fnanchor">[163]</a> is in a contemporary hand and is corroborated by
Pennington's Journal, now among the MSS. of Lord Muncaster.</p>

<p>In the summers of the years 1631, 1633 and 1634 Pennington
was in command of a small squadron as Admiral of the Narrow Seas,
charged especially with the duty of freeing the coast from
pirates. He tells us in his journal<a name="FNanchor_164" id="FNanchor_164"></a><a href="#Footnote_164" class="fnanchor">[164]</a>, under the above date (3rd July,
1633):</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>In the morninge it blew very hard at SW by W. Aboute noone we
weyed&mdash;leavinge the 8th Whelpe in Catt Water and stoode of to sea with
the rest of our Fleete, knowinge it to bee a very hard matter for any small
vessels to keepe the sea in such fowle weather, and the likelyest place
for them to shelter in with these winds was Torbaye, for which place
we stoode, causinge the 10th Whelpe to goe a head of us and close
aboard the shore, with her coullers and ordynance in, that shee might
not bee suspected to bee one of our Fleete, the better to intrap any
Pyrates.</p></div>

<p>The order, which is dated the same day on board the 'Vanguard,'
Pennington's flagship, is evidently the one given to the 10th Whelp<a name="FNanchor_165" id="FNanchor_165"></a><a href="#Footnote_165" class="fnanchor">[165]</a>.
It contains instructions as to rendezvous in case the ships lost company,
and continues as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="no-indent">you are to looke out carefully for these pirates night and day; that if it
be possible wee maie intrapp them. You are alsoe for this present service
to keepe in yo<sup>r</sup> Jack at yo<sup>r</sup> Boultsprit end and yo<sup>r</sup> Pendant and yo<sup>r</sup> Ordinance<a name="FNanchor_166" id="FNanchor_166"></a><a href="#Footnote_166" class="fnanchor">[166]</a>.</p></div>

<p>The fact that the position of the "Jack" is defined in this order
tends to show that the term had not yet become common, and this
is fully confirmed by a passage added by Sir Nathaniel Boteler to
one<a name="FNanchor_167" id="FNanchor_167"></a><a href="#Footnote_167" class="fnanchor">[167]</a> of the manuscript copies of his well-known <cite>Six Dialogues about
Sea Services</cite>, written about the year 1634.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span></p>

<p>Boteler, who last served at sea in the Ile de Ré Expedition of
1627, says:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="no-indent">but of late ther hathe bin invented an order that none of our Englishe
shypps should be allowed to carry the king's flagge (that is the English
Crosse quartered<a name="FNanchor_168" id="FNanchor_168"></a><a href="#Footnote_168" class="fnanchor">[168]</a> w<sup>h</sup> the Scottish, and called the Brittish flagge or Colours)
save only such shyps as are either of his Ma<sup>ties</sup> owne or serve under his
paye, and every such vessel, though but a Catche, is permitted and enjoined
to weare one of thes in a smale volume in her Boltsprites Topp.
And the flaggs thus worne are tearmed Jacks.</p></div>

<p>The "Order" referred to is evidently the Proclamation of 1634,
which, as already remarked, was the outcome of Pennington's request
for instructions. It seems highly probable that it is to the same outstanding
personality<a name="FNanchor_169" id="FNanchor_169"></a><a href="#Footnote_169" class="fnanchor">[169]</a> that we owe the institution of the "Jack" on
the bowsprit.</p>

<p>From 1634 until the death of Charles I the royal ships continued
to be distinguished from the merchant ships by this difference in
their flags, although, as a distinct favour, merchant ships were, in a
few special cases, granted permission to carry the Union flag.</p>

<p>The execution of Charles I on 30th January, 1649, dissolved the
dynastic union between England and Scotland. The two nations,
which only a few years before had been united in a "Solemn League
and Covenant" against Charles, had been gradually drifting apart,
and on the proclamation by the Scots of Charles' son as king the two
governments fell into open enmity. In these circumstances the Union
flag had become meaningless. On the 22nd of February the Parliament
decreed that the "Admiralty" should be settled in the Council
of State<a name="FNanchor_170" id="FNanchor_170"></a><a href="#Footnote_170" class="fnanchor">[170]</a>, and the "Navy Committee," that is, the Committee of the
Council, who were managing those affairs of the navy that had
formerly been within the jurisdiction of the "Principal Officers of
the Navy," immediately applied to the Council to know what they
were to do about flags.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>This Committee taking notice of the arms y<sup>t</sup> are engraven upon ye
sternes of ye shipps belonging to ye Comonwealth &amp; intended for this
Summers fleet doe think fit to inform the Com<sup>tee</sup> of State therewith that
so directions may be given what arms shalbe placed in their steed &amp; likewise
what characters shalbe given to the flaggs that are to be worne in
this service<a name="FNanchor_171" id="FNanchor_171"></a><a href="#Footnote_171" class="fnanchor">[171]</a>.</p></div>

<p>The Council of State promptly decided "That the Ships at Sea
in service of the State shall onely beare the red Crosse in a white
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>flag
<a name="FNanchor_172" id="FNanchor_172"></a><a href="#Footnote_172" class="fnanchor">[172]</a>," thus bringing the navy back to the old English flag and once
more into line with the merchant shipping. The royal arms were
ordered to be removed from the sterns and replaced by "the Armes
of England and Ireland in two Scutcheons<a name="FNanchor_173" id="FNanchor_173"></a><a href="#Footnote_173" class="fnanchor">[173]</a>."</p>

<p>Two days later the Generals at Sea were informed, in answer to a
further inquiry, that if Scots ships were found "bearing either the
red cross or the Armes heretofore called the King's Armes" they were
to admonish them to "forbeare the carrying of them for the future<a name="FNanchor_174" id="FNanchor_174"></a><a href="#Footnote_174" class="fnanchor">[174]</a>."</p>

<p>It is probable that the order of 22nd Feb. was not altogether
welcome to the navy officers, for on 5th March, only a few days
after the above order had been issued, the Council of State decided
upon a new union flag for naval use. The union now to be symbolised
was that of England and Ireland. Although Ireland had been more or
less under the rule of the kings of England from the time of Henry II,
it was not until the accession of James I in 1603 that she had found
recognition in the royal standard, and it remained for the Commonwealth
to give her due recognition in the national flag. The entry in
the Council Minute Book runs: "That the fflagg that is to be borne
by the Admirall be that now presented, viz: the Armes of England
and Ireland in two severall Escotchons in a red flagg w<sup>th</sup> in a Compartiment (or)<a name="FNanchor_175" id="FNanchor_175"></a><a href="#Footnote_175" class="fnanchor">[175]</a>."</p>

<p>At the same time two other variants of this design were introduced,
a standard and a jack. The order for these cannot be found,
but they are referred to in the following letter to the Committee of
the Navy signed by Deane and Blake (two of the Generals at Sea<a name="FNanchor_176" id="FNanchor_176"></a><a href="#Footnote_176" class="fnanchor">[176]</a>)
and dated 21st April, 1649:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
Gentlemen<br />
</p>

<p> &nbsp; &nbsp; Touching the flaggs &amp;c. It seems strange you referre the proportions
to bee ascertained by us, yo<sup>r</sup>selves knowing best the former allowaunces,
which wee suppose are alike in number in every expedition, but
since the Issue depends on o<sup>r</sup> resolution wee think needfull that you make
up what you have allready sent, for o<sup>r</sup>selves three Standards, o<sup>r</sup> viceadm<sup>ll</sup>
and Rereadm<sup>ll</sup> with the Adm<sup>ll</sup> Viceadm<sup>ll</sup> &amp; Rereadm<sup>ll</sup> of Ireland three
flaggs apiece, with two Jackes for every Shipp in the ffleet. ffor the Ensignes
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>and pendants you best know how many are wanting, which (whatsoever
they are) with the flaggs &amp;c. we desire may bee noe longer delayed<a name="FNanchor_177" id="FNanchor_177"></a><a href="#Footnote_177" class="fnanchor">[177]</a>.</p></div>

<p>In the standard, intended to replace the royal standard, and to be
used by the Generals at Sea, the yellow "compartment" was omitted
and the two escutcheons were surrounded by green branches of laurel
and bay. Fortunately, an actual specimen<a name="FNanchor_178" id="FNanchor_178"></a><a href="#Footnote_178" class="fnanchor">[178]</a> has survived of this interesting
flag, which was destined to wave over Blake's ship at the
heroic battle of Santa Cruz and to see the rise of the English navy to
an eminence unequalled even in the days of Elizabeth.</p>

<p>The jack contained only the cross and harp on their white and
blue fields, corresponding with the centre part of the Admirals' flags.
It is to be seen in several pictures of battles of the First Dutch War<a name="FNanchor_179" id="FNanchor_179"></a><a href="#Footnote_179" class="fnanchor">[179]</a>.
Apparently this jack was also used by ships having letters of marque;
"privateers" as we should now call them. In December, 1652, the
captain of a small frigate, called the 'Helena,' fought with two armed
ships from Brest, "putting out the Parliament Jack on the bowsprit
end and the English ensign on the poop, the enemy having hung out
the disunion flag or late King's colours<a name="FNanchor_180" id="FNanchor_180"></a><a href="#Footnote_180" class="fnanchor">[180]</a>."</p>

<p>Early in 1653 the junior Admiral's flag with the red border and
yellow compartment seems to have been abandoned, and a flag like
the jack, with the harp and cross only, substituted for it<a name="FNanchor_181" id="FNanchor_181"></a><a href="#Footnote_181" class="fnanchor">[181]</a>, probably
because the red border would cause confusion when flown in the
white and blue squadrons.</p>

<p>Scotland was formally re-united to England by an Ordinance of
the Commonwealth Parliament dated 12th April, 1654, and the cross
of St Andrew was ordered to be brought once more into conjunction
with that of St George:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>And that this Union may take its more full effect and intent Be it
further ordained by the Authority aforesaid That the Arms of Scotland
viz: a Cross commonly called Saint Andrews Cross be received into and
borne from henceforth in the Arms of this Commonwealth as a Badge of
this Union.</p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span></p>

<p class="no-indent">In the new great seal which was prepared in 1655 the St Andrew's
cross was quartered with St George's cross and the Irish harp, but it
was not at once introduced into the naval flags, although placed on
the obverse of naval medals struck in 1654.</p>

<p>The cross of St Andrew was re-introduced into the naval flags by
the following order of the Council of State dated 18th May, 1658<a name="FNanchor_182" id="FNanchor_182"></a><a href="#Footnote_182" class="fnanchor">[182]</a>:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>That the Standard for the Generall of his Highness ffleete be altered,
and doe beare the Armes of England, Scotland, and Ireland, with his
Highness Escutcheon of pretence, according to the impression of the
Great Seale of England; and that the Jack fflaggs for the fflagg officers of
the ffleete and for the severall Shipps of Warre of his Highness be the
Armes of England and Scotland united, according to the auncient forme,
With the addition of the Harpe, according to a Modell now showd; and
that the Com<sup>rs</sup> of the Adm<sup>ty</sup> and Navy to take order That the standard
and Jacke fflaggs be prepared accordingly.</p></div>

<p>In the standard the two crosses and the harp were borne "quarterly"
surmounted by an inescutcheon (sable, a lion rampant argent),
the personal arms of Cromwell<a name="FNanchor_183" id="FNanchor_183"></a><a href="#Footnote_183" class="fnanchor">[183]</a>, but in the other Admirals' flags and
the jack the crosses were superposed, as in the Union flag of 1606,
with the addition of a harp in the centre. The "model" has disappeared,
like all its predecessors, and nothing remains to show for
certain whether this harp was placed in a blue escutcheon as in the
earlier Commonwealth flags or not, but since a request was received
from Chatham in the following November for 200 yards of blue
bewper "for ye altering of all y<sup>e</sup> fflaggs and Jacks here y<sup>t</sup> are of y<sup>e</sup>
former fashion into y<sup>e</sup> new forme<a name="FNanchor_184" id="FNanchor_184"></a><a href="#Footnote_184" class="fnanchor">[184]</a>" it seems on the whole probable
that the harp was in an escutcheon with a blue field.</p>

<p>This return towards the flag of 1606, prophetic of the coming
restoration, lasted for a few months only. In September Cromwell
died, and his son, the shadow of a great name, after being tolerated
as a mere figurehead for a few months, was in the following May
forced to abdicate. The remnant of the Long Parliament, which had
just re-assembled, passed an "Act for the Great Seal of England"
which restored the seal of 1651 with its map of England and Ireland
and shields with the St George's cross and the Irish harp. The
cross of Scotland vanished and the Commonwealth "Cross and
Harp" jack supplanted Cromwell's Union Jack.</p>

<p>In March, 1660, the Navy Commissioners were told to furnish
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>General Mountagu, then in command of the Fleet
<a name="FNanchor_185" id="FNanchor_185"></a><a href="#Footnote_185" class="fnanchor">[185]</a>, "with Standards
for the Naseby suitable to the Jacks now worne in the ffleete<a name="FNanchor_186" id="FNanchor_186"></a><a href="#Footnote_186" class="fnanchor">[186]</a>." This
was the standard which Mountagu was flying when ordered to cross
to the Hague and bring back the king.</p>

<p>On 1st May, 1660, the newly assembled Houses of Parliament
passed a joint vote for the restoration of the ancient government,
and a few days later, before Charles was publicly proclaimed, the
Commissioners of the Admiralty and Navy, at the instance of the
Council of State, issued the following order to their subordinate
Board:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>In pursuance of an order of the Councell of State of the 5th of this
instant May It is ordered that it be referred to the Com<sup>rs</sup> for the Navy
forthwith to take care that such Standards, fflags and Jacke Colours for

and Painters be appointed to goe down for the altering of the Carved
workes according to such directions as they shall receive from Com<sup>r</sup> Pett,

as may compleate a suite for the Naseby<a name="FNanchor_187" id="FNanchor_187"></a><a href="#Footnote_187" class="fnanchor">[187]</a>.</p></div>

<p>Instructions to this effect must have reached the fleet before it
left England, but the flag-makers had evidently not had sufficient
time to prepare the new royal standard, for on the 13th May, on
the way over, (so Pepys, then secretary to Mountagu, tells us<a name="FNanchor_188" id="FNanchor_188"></a><a href="#Footnote_188" class="fnanchor">[188]</a>)</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="no-indent">the tailors and painters were at work cutting out some pieces of yellow
cloth into the fashion of a crown and C.R. and put it upon a fine sheet and
that into the flag instead of the State's arms<a name="FNanchor_189" id="FNanchor_189"></a><a href="#Footnote_189" class="fnanchor">[189]</a> which after dinner was finished
and set up.... In the afternoon a Council of War only to acquaint them that
the Harp must be taken out of all their flags, it being very offensive to the
King.</p></div>

<p>The Union flag, like the Government, now reverted to its original
form, but the right to fly it remained the special prerogative of the
State's ships, a prerogative much sought after by merchant ships, and
often assumed by them without warrant. For the next half century
a long-drawn struggle was waged by the merchant shipping for the
possession of this right. It begins with a special instruction sent by
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>the Lord High Admiral, James Duke of York, to the Corporation of
Trinity House on 9th March, 1661:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>I desire you will give notice unto all Commanders and Masters of
Shipping belonging to the Subjects of the King, my Sovereign Lord and
Brother, that from henceforward they forbear to wear the Flag of Union;
and also acquaint them, that such as presume to wear the said Flag contrary
hereunto, the King's Ships will have orders to take it from them<a name="FNanchor_190" id="FNanchor_190"></a><a href="#Footnote_190" class="fnanchor">[190]</a>.</p></div>

<p>The Trinity House issued orders to this effect, but although the
prohibition had been stiffened with a threat that the flag would be
taken by force from those displaying it, the notices seem to have had
so little effect that, on 19th Nov., when a royal proclamation was
issued "For prohibiting the Imbezlement of His Majesties Stores,"
the opportunity was taken to make the further threat that the Commander
of the ship would be seized also:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>And for preventing the abuse which hath been of late practised concerning
Flags, Pendents and other Ornaments His Majesty doth hereby
strictly prohibit &amp; forbid the use of His Majesties Colours in Merchant
Ships, and doth Authorize and Command all Commanders and Officers
of any His Majesties Ships of War not only to take from Merchants Ships
all such Colours but likewise to seize the Commander of such Merchant
Ships, wherein after the first day of April next they shall be used, and to
bring them to condign punishment<a name="FNanchor_191" id="FNanchor_191"></a><a href="#Footnote_191" class="fnanchor">[191]</a>.</p></div>

<p>It is interesting to find here, as in 1634, an excuse made for the
order which is not the main reason for it. No doubt a certain number
of colours were embezzled and sold by the boatswains of the king's
ships, just as the gunners embezzled and sold the powder, but the
desire of the merchant shipping to fly the Union flag was not due to
the fact that they might occasionally pick that flag up cheap, it was
due rather to the privileges, especially freedom from pilotage and port
dues in foreign ports, which the flag assured them.</p>

<p>Probably the further threat of imprisonment checked the practice
for a time, but not entirely, for the Lord High Admiral was again
taking action in 1666.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Deterred by these measures from a direct attempt to make use
of the Union flag, the merchant shipping hit upon the device of
flying a flag which was a sufficiently close imitation of the forbidden
colours to deceive foreign powers<a name="FNanchor_193" id="FNanchor_193"></a><a href="#Footnote_193" class="fnanchor">[193]</a> without falling within the strict
letter of the law. In 1674 this practice had evidently become common,
for Pepys acquainted the Trinity House, in June, of the King's intention
to put a stop to it<a name="FNanchor_194" id="FNanchor_194"></a><a href="#Footnote_194" class="fnanchor">[194]</a>. Three months later the following proclamation
was issued:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Whereas by ancient usage no merchant's ship ought to bear the Jack,
which is for distinction appointed for his Majesty's ships; nevertheless his
Majesty is informed that divers of his Majesty's subjects have of late presumed
to wear his Majesty's Jack on board their ships employed in merchants'
affairs, and thinking to evade the Punishment due for the same,
bear Jacks in shape and mixture of colours so little different from those of
his Majesty as not to be without difficulty distinguisht therefrom, which
practice is found attended with manifold Inconveniences; for prevention
whereof for the future his Majesty hath thought fit, with the advice of his
Privy Council, by this his Royal Proclamation, strictly to charge and
command all his subjects whatsoever, that from henceforth they do not
presume to wear his Majesty's Jack (commonly called The Union Jack)
in any of their ships or vessels, without particular warrant for their so
doing from his Majesty, or the Lord High Admiral of England, or the
Commissioners for executing the office of Lord High Admiral for the time
being; and his Majesty doth hereby further command all his loving subjects,
that without such warrant as aforesaid, they presume not to wear on
board their ships or vessels, any Jacks made in imitation of his Majesty's,
or any other flags, Jacks, or Ensigns whatsoever, than those usually heretofore
worn on merchants' ships, viz., the Flag and Jack White, with a
Red Cross (commonly called Saint George's Cross) passing right through
the same; and the Ensign Red, with a like Cross in a Canton White, at
the upper corner thereof next to the staff.</p>

<p>And his Majesty doth hereby require the principal officers and Commissioners
of his navy, Governors of his Forts and Castles, the Officers
of his Customs, and Commanders or officers of any of his Majesty's ships,
upon their meeting with, or otherwise observing any merchants' ships or
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>vessels of his Majesty's subjects wearing such a flag, jack, or ensign, contrary
hereunto, whether at Sea or in Port, not only to cause such flag, jack
or ensign to be forthwith seized, but to return the names of the said ships
and vessels, together with the names of their respective masters, unto the
Lord High Admiral, Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty, or the
Judge of the High Court of Admiralty for the time being, to the end the
Persons offending may be duly punished for the same.</p>

<p>And his Majesty doth hereby command and enjoyn the Judge and
Judges of the High Court of Admiralty for the time being, that at the
several Sessions to be hereafter held by his Majesty's Commission of Oyer
and Terminer for the Admiralty, they give in charge, that strict enquiry
be made of all offences in the premises, and that they cause all offenders
therein to be duly punished. And all Vice Admirals and Judges of Vice
Admiralties, are also to do the same, and to attend the due observation
hereof, within the several Ports and Places of their respective Precincts.</p>

</div>

<p>A new competitor for the privilege now appeared in the yacht&mdash;a
type of pleasure-boat introduced from the Netherlands at the
Restoration. In 1676 the request of the Governor of Dover "to have
the liberty of wearing his Maj<sup>ts</sup> Jack upon his private yacht" was
refused by the king in Council<a name="FNanchor_195" id="FNanchor_195"></a><a href="#Footnote_195" class="fnanchor">[195]</a>, but the practice of hoisting the
Union Jack upon yachts without warrant had become sufficiently
widespread by 1686 to attract the notice of the navy authorities, as
shown by the following memorandum of Pepys:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Notes about the Jack taken by S. P. at the Navy Board the 20th of
Sept<sup>r</sup> 1686 upon occasion of the liberty taken by Private Yachts to wear
the Kings Jack without License.</p>

<p>Memorandum. That the temptations to this Liberty (besides the pride
of it) are</p>

<p>1st. That in Holland they are freed by it from taking a Pilot.</p>

<p>2dly. As to France they are by the Jack excused from paying the Duty
of 50 Sous by Tun paid by every Mercht Man coming into a French Port.</p>

<p>3dly. All our Merchant Men lower their Topsails below Gravesend to
any ship or vessel carrying the King's Jack, be it but a Victualling Hoy<a name="FNanchor_196" id="FNanchor_196"></a><a href="#Footnote_196" class="fnanchor">[196]</a>.</p></div>

<p>About this time another form of jack had come into use in the
Mediterranean. Its origin is obscure: we first meet with it in some
notes of matters to be looked into jotted down by Pepys about 1687:
"Quaere, the Practice of wearing Colours in Boats? And the Budgee<a name="FNanchor_197" id="FNanchor_197"></a><a href="#Footnote_197" class="fnanchor">[197]</a>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>Jack now familiarly used abroad (as lately by St Loe
<a name="FNanchor_198" id="FNanchor_198"></a><a href="#Footnote_198" class="fnanchor">[198]</a>) being the
Union Jack in a Canton upon a Red Flag." It will be seen from this
note that it was of similar design to the red ensign instituted in 1707,
and from the juxtaposition of "Colours in Boats" it may be inferred
that it was a combination of the jack and red ensign for use in boats
only. It was afterwards made the distinctive jack of a privateer<a name="FNanchor_199" id="FNanchor_199"></a><a href="#Footnote_199" class="fnanchor">[199]</a>.</p>

<p>For the next few years more serious matters than the misuse of
the Union Jack occupied the attention of the authorities, but in
1694<a name="FNanchor_200" id="FNanchor_200"></a><a href="#Footnote_200" class="fnanchor">[200]</a>, when William III was safely seated on the throne, another
Proclamation, similar to that of 1674, was issued forbidding merchant
ships, except those having letters of marque, to wear other colours
than the "Flag and Jack white with a Red Cross commonly called
St George's Cross passing quite through the same and the Ensign
Red with the like Cross in a Canton White at the upper corner thereof
next the staff." The privateers were to wear the same ensign as other
merchant ships, but were to have the red (Budgee) jack.</p>

<p>Another Proclamation in identical terms was issued in the first
year of Queen Anne's reign<a name="FNanchor_201" id="FNanchor_201"></a><a href="#Footnote_201" class="fnanchor">[201]</a>.</p>

<p>Meanwhile yet another variant of the Union Jack had been created
for the use of ships commissioned by the Governors of the North
American Colonies. In July, 1701, the Admiralty complained to the
Council of "the inconvenience by Merchant Ships wearing the King's
Colours in and among the Plantations abroad, under colour of Commissions
from the Governors of the said Plantations," and obtained
the Council's approval to the use by such vessels of a distinctive Jack
which is thus described in the Instructions to the Governors.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Whereas great inconveniences do happen by Merchant Ships and other
Vessels in the Plantations wearing the Colours born by our Ships of War
under pretence of Commissions granted to them by the Governors of the
said Plantations, and that by trading under those Colours, not only amongst
our own Subjects, but also those of other Princes and States, and Committing
divers Irregularities, they do very much dishonour our Service&mdash;For
prevention whereof you are to oblige the Commanders of all such
Ships, to which you shall grant Commissions, to wear no other Jack than
according to the Sample here described, that is to say, such as is worn
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>by our Ships of War, with the distinction of a White Escutchion in the
middle thereof and that the said mark of distinction may extend itself to
one half of the depth of the Jack and one third of the Fly thereof<a name="FNanchor_202" id="FNanchor_202"></a><a href="#Footnote_202" class="fnanchor">[202]</a>.</p></div>

<p class="p2" />
<p>In 1707 was brought about that complete union of England and
Scotland that James had worked for a hundred years before. The
first article in the Treaty of Union provided that the crosses of
St George and St Andrew should be conjoined in such manner as
the queen thought fit. After due consideration of various designs
suggested by a Committee of the Privy Council in conjunction with
the Heralds College, it was finally decided by an Order in Council
of 17th April, 1707, "That the Union Flag continue as at present."
Coloured drawings of the Royal Standard, Union Flag, and Red
Ensign were formally communicated to the Admiralty by a further
Order in Council with instructions that these designs were to be
adhered to in the flags flown at sea<a name="FNanchor_203" id="FNanchor_203"></a><a href="#Footnote_203" class="fnanchor">[203]</a>.</p>

<p>But although no change was made in the Union flag an important
alteration was made in the Ensign; the English and Scots navies being
now united, the Union was introduced into its canton in place of the
St George.</p>

<p>In promulgating<a name="FNanchor_204" id="FNanchor_204"></a><a href="#Footnote_204" class="fnanchor">[204]</a> this change of ensign opportunity was taken to
repeat the thunders of the former proclamations against the offending
merchant service, but with the inclusion of the Union in the ensign
the fight practically came to an end. Before long the general introduction
of fore and aft headsails led to the disappearance of the sprit
topmast on which the jack had been displayed, and as the flagstaff
on the bowsprit, which took its place, was in the way of the jib when
headsails were set, it became the common practice to fly a jack only
when the ship was in harbour.</p>

<p>With the opening of the nineteenth century came the final change
in the design of the Union flag. By the Act of 1800 the union of
Great Britain and Ireland was to take effect from the first day of the
new century, and by the first of the Articles of Union the "Ensigns,
Armorial Flags and Banners" were to be such as the king by "Royal
Proclamation under the Great Seal of the said United Kingdom
should appoint."</p>

<p>The Privy Council, after consulting the Heralds, recommended
to the king "that the Union Flag should be altered according to the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>Draft thereof marked (C) in which the Cross of St George is conjoined
with the Crosses of St Andrew and St Patrick." This proposal
was approved by Order in Council of the 5th November, 1800.</p>

<p>The Proclamation<a name="FNanchor_205" id="FNanchor_205"></a><a href="#Footnote_205" class="fnanchor">[205]</a> was issued on the 1st January, 1801. It decreed</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="no-indent">that the Union Flag shall be azure, the Crosses Saltires of St Andrew and
St Patrick Quarterly per Saltire, counterchanged Argent and Gules; the
latter fimbriated of the Second<a name="FNanchor_206" id="FNanchor_206"></a><a href="#Footnote_206" class="fnanchor">[206]</a> surmounted by the Cross of St George
of the Third<a name="FNanchor_207" id="FNanchor_207"></a><a href="#Footnote_207" class="fnanchor">[207]</a>, fimbriated as the Saltire.</p></div>

<p>In his desire to adhere to those pedantic formulae which came
into being during the decadence of heraldic art, the draftsman of
this clause was unfortunately obscure in a matter that called for the
clearest precision. The "Draft marked C" showed a fimbriation or
border for the St George's cross nearly as wide as the counterchanged
saltires<a name="FNanchor_208" id="FNanchor_208"></a><a href="#Footnote_208" class="fnanchor">[208]</a>. This drawing and the verbal blason of it above
recited, were supplied to the Council by Sir Isaac Heard, the Garter
King-at-Arms, and since in so important a matter he is not likely to
have been guilty of carelessness, while there is no question of incompetence,
it is clear that "fimbriated as the saltire" was not intended
to denote that the border was to be of the same width as for the
saltire, but simply that this border was to be of the same colour. In
other words, a fimbriation was not so strictly defined as to width in
1800 as some persons at the present day would have us believe.</p>

<p>There would be no need to dwell upon this point were it not for
the importance of this flag and the confusion into which the details
of its construction have fallen.</p>

<p>It may seem an extraordinary statement to make, but it is a fact
that the Union flag is never made in strict accordance with the
original design.</p>

<p>In the pattern approved for the navy<a name="FNanchor_209" id="FNanchor_209"></a><a href="#Footnote_209" class="fnanchor">[209]</a>, which is also that flown
on the Houses of Parliament and on the Government Offices, and is
that adopted almost universally by private individuals of British
nationality, the Irish saltire is reduced in width by having its fimbriation
taken from itself instead of from the blue ground. Apparently
this has been done to bring the outer boundaries in line across the
flag, but it seems neither heraldically nor historically correct, for the
saltire representing Ireland<a name="FNanchor_210" id="FNanchor_210"></a><a href="#Footnote_210" class="fnanchor">[210]</a> should be of equal width with that of
Scotland.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span></p>

<p>The other pattern in use is that established in 1900 by the War
Office, in an attempt to comply with the literal terms of the Proclamation
of 1st January, 1801, as interpreted by modern heraldic definitions<a name="FNanchor_211" id="FNanchor_211"></a><a href="#Footnote_211" class="fnanchor">[211]</a>.
In this pattern the two saltires are of equal breadth, but the
"fimbriation" of the St George's cross has been reduced to the same
width as that of St Patrick's saltire.</p>

<p>However, these differences are of no serious importance, and
indeed this flag seems doomed to misrepresentation, which extends
even to its name. A "Union Jack" is, correctly speaking, a small
Union flag intended to be flown in one particular place, the bows
of one of H.M. ships: yet for many years past this technical distinction
has been lost sight of<a name="FNanchor_212" id="FNanchor_212"></a><a href="#Footnote_212" class="fnanchor">[212]</a> and the misapplication of the term "Jack"
has become almost universal, so much so that we have the Government
solemnly announcing that "The Union <em>Jack</em> should be regarded
as the national flag<a name="FNanchor_213" id="FNanchor_213"></a><a href="#Footnote_213" class="fnanchor">[213]</a>."</p>

<p>The Union Pendant, that is a pendant with St George's Cross
at the head and with the fly striped longitudinally red, white and
blue (see <a href="#PLATE_V">Plate V</a>, fig. 2) appears to have been first instituted in 1661
as a pendant which combined the colours of the Union flag and
which, like that flag, was to be flown only by H.M. ships. It was
afterwards known as the "Ordinary" or "Common" Pendant<a name="FNanchor_214" id="FNanchor_214"></a><a href="#Footnote_214" class="fnanchor">[214]</a>. It
went out of use when the squadronal colours were abandoned in
1864, though it survives in a smaller form (in which the fly is not
slit) to this day as a signal that the ship's company is engaged in
divine service.</p>

 The name "Budgee," in flag-books of the early eighteenth century, is derived
from Bugia (Bougie) in Algeria. In the tenth century this was one of the most
important seaports in North Africa, but in the seventeenth century it was fast
falling into decay, and beyond the fact that the Algerine pirates lying there were
successfully attacked by Sir Edward Spragge in 1673 there was nothing to connect
the name with the English navy.</p></div>

<h4><a name="Chapter_IVa" id="Chapter_IVa"></a><a href="#CONTENTS">(i) THE ROYAL STANDARD</a></h4>

<p class="drop-cap2"><span class="smcap">Highest</span> in dignity among the flags which have been used to
denote the leader of a British fleet comes the Royal Banner
commonly spoken of as the Royal Standard.</p>

<p>Its use in this connection has for very many years been obsolete,
but before noting the occasions on which it has been flown for this
purpose it will be convenient to sketch its history down to our own
times.</p>

<p>The royal arms make their first<a name="FNanchor_215" id="FNanchor_215"></a><a href="#Footnote_215" class="fnanchor">[215]</a> appearance in 1189 in the Great
Seal of Richard I as a single lion rampant contourné upon the king's
shield. In Richard's second seal, made in 1198 to replace the first one
which was lost during his captivity, the single lion became the three
lions<a name="FNanchor_216" id="FNanchor_216"></a><a href="#Footnote_216" class="fnanchor">[216]</a> passant guardant in pale which have remained in the arms of
England until the present day. In 1339 Edward III, angered at the
assistance given by Philip of France to the King of Scotland, took
steps to assert a claim to the throne of France, and, in earnest of this,
in January, 1340, he formally assumed the title and arms of King of
France, quartering the arms of France (azure semé of fleurs-de-lis)
with those of England in the royal banner and on the great seal. In
doing this he, somewhat unpatriotically, placed the arms of France
in the first and third quarters, thereby giving them precedence over
those of England.</p>

<p class="p2" />
<p>From this date<a name="FNanchor_217" id="FNanchor_217"></a><a href="#Footnote_217" class="fnanchor">[217]</a> until the death of Elizabeth these were the royal
arms of England, but during the reign of Richard II (1377-99) the
legendary arms of Edward the Confessor (or, a cross patoncé between
five martlets on a field azure) were impaled with them, and Queen
Mary, after her marriage with Philip of Spain, impaled the arms of
Spain. About the year 1411 Henry IV, in imitation of the change
made by Charles V in his arms, reduced the fleurs-de-lis to three in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>number. On the accession of James I it became necessary to add the
arms of Scotland (or, a lion rampant within a double tressure flory
and counterflory, gules) and in doing this James took the opportunity
to add arms representing Ireland. For these he took the badge chosen
for Ireland by Henry VIII (a harp or, stringed argent). Mr Serjeant
Knight, in the memorandum referred to on <a href="#Page_57">p. 57</a> becomes very
indignant over this harp, and gives vent to his feelings in the following
words:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>At the same time (upon what consideration I am ignorant) something
was to be added for ye Kingdome of Ireland or something that might
signify so much and ye Harpe (as at present borne) it seems resolv'd on.
But for what reasons am as ignorant as for ye former, ye Harpe being no
more the Armes of that Kingdome or of any one from whence that King
was lineally descended than any other Constellation or any of ye Signes
of the Zodiack. Having often contemplated this, ye only satisfaction I
could forme to myselfe was from ye temper of ye times &amp; doe suspect
ye Leaven of Puritanisme in it by soe readily foysting this to ye exclusion
of that of his Mat<sup>y</sup> had (as has all his Posterity) an indisputable Hereditary
Right unto, equal to that of England, ... viz the Arms of Ulster: or, a cross
gules.</p></div>

<p>This harp was not the ancient arms of Ireland. Those arms are
supposed to have been three crowns in pale in a blue field, but as
there was never a native king of the whole of Ireland it is clear that
there could never have been a native coat of arms representative of
the whole country. Placing the arms quarterly of France and England
in the first and fourth quarters of his shield, James put those of
Scotland in the second quarter and those of Ireland in the third.
This arrangement was, however, not invariable. In some of the Irish
seals<a name="FNanchor_218" id="FNanchor_218"></a><a href="#Footnote_218" class="fnanchor">[218]</a> Ireland is found in the second place and Scotland in the third,
while in the Great Seal of Scotland made in James II's reign the
arms of Scotland occupy the first and fourth quarters, with England
second and Ireland third.</p>

<p>After the execution of Charles I, the royal standard was replaced
by the Commonwealth standard, with the cross and harp<a name="FNanchor_219" id="FNanchor_219"></a><a href="#Footnote_219" class="fnanchor">[219]</a>. During
the Protectorate (1653-9) the standard consisted of: 1 and 4 the
cross of St George, 2 the cross of St Andrew, and 3 the Irish harp,
with an inescutcheon of the arms of Cromwell (sable a lion rampant,
argent)<a name="FNanchor_220" id="FNanchor_220"></a><a href="#Footnote_220" class="fnanchor">[220]</a>. The Commonwealth standard came back for a few months
in 1659-60, to be replaced by the royal standard of James I; the
makeshift used by Mountagu while on his way to fetch Charles II
back to the throne has already been described.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span></p>

<p>The remaining changes have been succinctly described by
Mr Fox-Davies<a name="FNanchor_221" id="FNanchor_221"></a><a href="#Footnote_221" class="fnanchor">[221]</a> as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>When William III and Mary came to the throne an inescutcheon of
the arms of Nassau (Azure, billetty and a lion rampant or) was superimposed
upon the Royal Arms as previously borne, for William III, and he
impaled the same coat without the inescutcheon for his wife. At her death
the impalement was dropped. After the Union with Scotland in 1707 the
arms of England (Gules, three lions, etc.) were impaled with those of
Scotland (the tressure not being continued down the palar line), and the
impaled coat of England and Scotland was placed in the first and fourth
quarters, France in the second, Ireland in the third.</p>

<p>At the accession of George I. the arms of Hanover were introduced in
the fourth quarter. These were: Tierced in pairle reversed, 1. Brunswick,
gules, two lions passant guardant in pale or; 2. Luneberg, or, semé of
hearts gules, a lion rampant azure; 3. (in point), Westphalia, gules a horse
courant argent, and on an inescutcheon (over the fourth quarter) gules,
the crown of Charlemagne (as Arch Treasurer of the Holy Roman Empire).</p>

<p>At the union with Ireland in 1801 the opportunity was taken to revise
the Royal Arms, and those of France were then discontinued. The escutcheon
decided upon at that date was: Quarterly, 1 and 4, England;
2. Scotland; 3. Ireland, and the arms of Hanover were placed upon an
inescutcheon. This inescutcheon was surmounted by the Electoral cap,
for which a crown was substituted later when Hanover became a kingdom.</p>

<p>At the death of William IV., by the operation of the Salic Law, the
crowns of England and Hanover were separated, and the inescutcheon of
Hanover disappeared from the Royal Arms of this country, and by Royal
Warrant issued at the beginning of the reign of Queen Victoria the Royal
Arms and badges were declared to be: 1 and 4, England; 2. Scotland;
3. Ireland.</p></div>

<div class="caption">PLATE VII &mdash; Royal Standards</div>
</div>

<p class="p2" />
<p>The principles which governed the use of the royal standard at
sea prior to the sixteenth century are somewhat obscure. In the thirteenth
century and early part of the fourteenth the three lions (or
leopards) of England appear to have been regarded not only as the
personal arms of the Sovereign but also as the English national
emblem, and to have been used as such by all ships, royal and
merchant. By the addition, in January, 1340, of the arms of France,
Edward III adopted a royal standard that could no longer be regarded
in this light. Yet although the royal standard now became more peculiarly
the personal ensign of the king it is clear, from the frequency
with which this flag occurs in inventories of ships' stores, that its use
was not confined to ships in which the king or his admiral were embarked.
It seems, however, to have been flown only on ships temporarily
or permanently in the king's service, and to have been displayed
by such ships from the deck, in company with the flag of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
St George and other flags containing royal badges, or emblems representative
of the saints after whom the ships were named.</p>

<p>There was, however, some distinction by which the presence of
the king could be denoted, and this difference lay most probably in
the position of the standard. We know that the "banner of council"
placed in the shrouds as a signal to call the council to the flagship,
which is the earliest signal recorded as used in the English fleet, dates
from this period, and that it contained the royal arms, with angelic
supporters, or impaled with the cross of St George, and that from
the sixteenth to the eighteenth century this "banner" was the royal
standard<a name="FNanchor_222" id="FNanchor_222"></a><a href="#Footnote_222" class="fnanchor">[222]</a>. But the most prominent position for a flag worn in a ship
is at the masthead, and it would seem that it was this position of the
standard that was reserved for the king or his deputy, the Lord
Admiral. When Edward III led the English fleet to the attack on the
French fleet at Sluys in June, 1340, his ship was decorated with banners
and streamers containing the new royal arms, and had a silver-gilt
crown at the masthead.</p>

<div class="blockquot" lang="fro" xml:lang="fro">

<p>Li rois estoit en un vassiel moult fort et moult biel qui avoit esté fais,
ouvrés et carpentés a Zandwich et estoit armés et parés de banières et

<p class="no-indent">It was, however, not the gilt crown but the flags that denoted the
king's presence, for Froissart explains that it was by these flags that
the French knew the king was himself present. "<span lang="fro" xml:lang="fro">Bien veoient entre

personelment</span><a name="FNanchor_225" id="FNanchor_225"></a><a href="#Footnote_225" class="fnanchor">[225]</a>."</p>

<p>In 1495, when Henry VII was encouraging John Cabot and his
sons in their voyages of discovery, he granted them the right to fly
the royal banners and flags: "<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">plenam ac liberam authoritatem, facultatem
et potestatem navigandi ad omnes partes ... sub banneris, vexillis,
et insigniis nostris</span><a name="FNanchor_226" id="FNanchor_226"></a><a href="#Footnote_226" class="fnanchor">[226]</a>," presumably in the same way as they were
flown on the royal ships.</p>

<p>The earliest surviving orders directing the Lord High Admiral
to fly the royal standard at the masthead are those of 1545, at the
end of Henry VIII's reign. "Item the Lord Admiral shall beare one
banner of the Kings Maj<sup>ts</sup> Arms in his mayne topp and one flag of
saint George crosse in his foretopp<a name="FNanchor_227" id="FNanchor_227"></a><a href="#Footnote_227" class="fnanchor">[227]</a>."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span></p>

<p>The royal standard was flown at the main, with the St George
at the fore, by Howard during the Armada fights in 1588 and during
the Cadiz Expedition of 1596. In 1618, by arrangement with the
Marquis (afterwards Duke) of Buckingham, Howard (then Earl of
Nottingham) resigned the office, which was transferred to the Marquis.
Buckingham made his first appearance at sea as Lord High
Admiral when he accompanied Prince Charles on his return from
Spain in 1623. For this voyage, a not inconsiderable sum of money
was expended in flags, which included:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="no-indent">
Ye great silke flagg w<sup>th</sup> ye Kings Armes for ye Prince<br />
the great fflag w<sup>th</sup> ye Princes Armes &amp; ye armes of Spaine empaled<br />

an Ensigne w<sup>th</sup> ye L<sup>d</sup> Admiralls Badge and Motto<a name="FNanchor_228" id="FNanchor_228"></a><a href="#Footnote_228" class="fnanchor">[228]</a><br />
</p></div>


<p class="no-indent">with a number of other flags, ensigns and pendants. As the Prince
had a special silk standard, it would seem that one of the other
standards was for Buckingham<a name="FNanchor_229" id="FNanchor_229"></a><a href="#Footnote_229" class="fnanchor">[229]</a>. The Earl of Rutland was in command
of this fleet on its outward voyage to Santander, and apparently he was
given permission to fly the standard while in supreme command.</p>

<p>The following year Sir R. Bingley was instructed to put his
lieutenant, with the king's standard, in a ship to transport the
Spanish Ambassador across the Channel<a name="FNanchor_230" id="FNanchor_230"></a><a href="#Footnote_230" class="fnanchor">[230]</a>. This was a somewhat
extraordinary use of the standard, for, with the disuse of flags placed
along the bulwarks, it had ceased to be generally flown on ships-of-war.
The standard was, however, flown on special occasions by high
officers other than the Lord High Admiral when in command of
fleets. Wimbledon wore it in the Cadiz Expedition of 1625, and no
less than £36 (equivalent to about £400 to-day) was spent on "the
great silke fflagg w<sup>th</sup> his Ma<sup>ts</sup> Armes guilded w<sup>th</sup> fyne gould and
wrought w<sup>th</sup> oyle Coll<sup>rs</sup>," and it was worn by the Earl of Denbigh
in 1628: but when the Earl of Lindsey, who had been appointed one
of the Commissioners for the Admiralty after the murder of Buckingham,
moved heaven and earth for permission to wear it while in
command of the fleet in 1635, alleging among other reasons that it
had been flown by the Earls of Arundel and Rutland and by Sir Robert
Mansell, and that he himself had had the honour previously, his
repeated applications were in vain; and so "a little maimed" he had
to content himself with the Union flag at the mainmasthead.</p>

<p>During the Civil War the Lord High Admiral's standard held a
very anomalous position. In 1642 the Parliament had appointed the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>Earl of Warwick to the office in defiance of the king's wishes, and,
although in active opposition to the king, he flew the royal standard.
In the summer of 1648 the fleet he commanded lay off the Dutch
coast, watching the royalist fleet under the command of Prince
Charles. When the Prince summoned Warwick to take down his
standard the Earl replied: "I am appointed by both Houses of the
Parliament of England to be Lord High Admiral of England, by
which right I bear the Standard<a name="FNanchor_231" id="FNanchor_231"></a><a href="#Footnote_231" class="fnanchor">[231]</a>." The fleets never came to blows
or the two standards might have got a little mixed. Warwick had,
however, provided against this eventuality just before leaving England
by supplying his fleet with pendants of his personal colours<a name="FNanchor_232" id="FNanchor_232"></a><a href="#Footnote_232" class="fnanchor">[232]</a>.</p>

<p>Shortly after this, the command of the royalist ships was handed
over to Prince Rupert, and in order that the Parliamentary Naval
forces might not have the monopoly of the standard he was given
permission to fly one when he thought fit.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Sir Edward Hyde to Prince Rupert.</p>

<p class="right">Hague 27 Jan. 1649. &nbsp; &nbsp; <br /></p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Your order for wearing the Standard.... I promised the Prince to
give your Highness advertisement of the debate concerning this wearing
the standard; in which I learned many things, which I never heard before.
It is agreed by all that the standard is properly and of right to be worn
only by the Lord High Admiral of England; &amp; when I enquired of the
order granted for the Lord Willoughby or Sir William Batten's wearing it,
it is said, that it was thought then necessary, since the Earl of Warwick
wore a standard, that whosoever commanded the fleet that was to fight
against him, should wear one, lest the seamen should be discouraged, and
look upon the Earl as the greater person; so that it is the opinion of all,
that, when you are like to engage with the Rebel's fleet, your men may
expect you should wear that ensign. It is therefore wholly referred to your
Highness to wear it upon any occasions you think fit<a name="FNanchor_233" id="FNanchor_233"></a><a href="#Footnote_233" class="fnanchor">[233]</a>.</p>
</div>

<p>At the request of the Council of State, the office of Lord High
Admiral was abolished in 1649 and its powers transferred to the
Council, but as the high authority exercised by the new "Generals
at Sea" was in many respects like that formerly exercised by the
Lord High Admiral they were empowered to wear at the main masthead
the special "standard" referred to above (<a href="#Page_64">p. 64</a>) which now took
the place of the standard with the royal arms. In this "standard,"
which was really only a modification of the "union" flag, the English
lions were replaced by the St George's cross, the Scottish and French
arms disappeared, and only those of Ireland remained. This upstart
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>flag soon acquired an honour in battle that had been sadly lacking to
the old one since 1588, for it waved over the heroic fights of the First
Dutch War and the action at Santa Cruz. In May, 1658, it was superseded
at sea by the standard that had been assigned to the Protector
in 1653 (see <a href="#Page_65">p. 65</a>), but this flag saw no great deeds and disappeared
early in 1659, to be replaced by the Commonwealth standard. When
Mountagu went over in May, 1660, to fetch back Charles to the throne
no royal standard was forthcoming, so he improvised one as already
related (see <a href="#Page_66">p. 66</a>).</p>

<p>With the restoration of the Stuarts in 1660 the royal standard
resumed its place as the Lord Admiral's flag, but with the anchor
flag as a substitute when the presence of the king rendered the use
of the standard by the Lord Admiral undesirable.</p>

<p>When William of Orange came over in 1688 to take possession of
the throne of Great Britain for himself and his wife he flew a red
standard containing in an escutcheon his arms impaled with the
Stuart royal arms, with the legend "For the Protestant Religion and
the Liberties of England" above the escutcheon and his motto "je
maintiendray" below<a name="FNanchor_234" id="FNanchor_234"></a><a href="#Footnote_234" class="fnanchor">[234]</a>; but when the joint sovereigns had been formally
proclaimed king and queen they adopted the Stuart standard
with an inescutcheon of Nassau already described.</p>

<p>The restriction in the use of the standard which had been rapidly
growing<a name="FNanchor_235" id="FNanchor_235"></a><a href="#Footnote_235" class="fnanchor">[235]</a> since the beginning of the seventeenth century, reached its
culmination in 1702, when the anchor flag definitely superseded it
as the Lord Admiral's flag, although, curiously enough, the standard
remained in use as a signal flag (for calling a council of flag officers)
for nearly another century.</p>

<p>The reason of the abandonment of the royal standard in 1702
does not appear. In February the Earl of Pembroke, recently appointed
Lord High Admiral by William III, had given instructions
for his flagship, the 'Britannia,' then fitting out at Chatham in preparation
for the French War, to be supplied with a standard, but on
the 20th March, just after the accession of Queen Anne, he wrote to
the Navy Board:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Notwithstanding any former Orders from me for your preparing any
of the Royal Standards of England, I do hereby desire and direct you to
forbear doing thereof, but you are to cause to be prepar'd for me as soon
as conveniently may be, so many of these flags<a name="FNanchor_236" id="FNanchor_236"></a><a href="#Footnote_236" class="fnanchor">[236]</a> which particularly have
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>been worn by the Lord high Adm<sup>ll</sup> of England &amp;c., by vertue of his Office,
as may be necessary for my Shipp and Boat<a name="FNanchor_237" id="FNanchor_237"></a><a href="#Footnote_237" class="fnanchor">[237]</a>,</p>
</div>

<p class="no-indent">and with this the long-continued existence of the royal standard as
a naval flag of command came to an end.</p>

<p>A number of interesting examples of the use of the standard at
sea by the king and by the Lord High Admiral (the Duke of York)
in 1672 are given in the Journal of Sir John Narborough, then lieutenant
in the Lord High Admiral's flagship, among them the following:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Tuesday being 23rd.... This day the King came on board.... At his
coming this day we put abroad a silk Ensigne and a silk Jack and all silk
Pendants at every yard arm and Top mast head, and at the Main topmasthead
the silk Standard of England, and at the Fore topmasthead a silk
Flagg Red with a yellow anchor and cable in the Fly: and at the mizen
topmasthead a Union Flagg. These we wore all flying while the King was
aboard: But when the King went out of the Ship and left the Duke aboard
the Red flagg was taken in at the Foremasthead, which had the Anchor
and Cable in it, and hoisted up at the Maintopmasthead. The Standard
being struck there, and the Union Flagg at the Mizen topmasthead was
struck....</p>

<p>Wednesday being 5th. (June 1672).... This day the King and several of
the noblemen came on board the Prince<a name="FNanchor_238" id="FNanchor_238"></a><a href="#Footnote_238" class="fnanchor">[238]</a>. His Royal Highness caused the
Standard to be struck when the King's Standard was in sight, and when
the King was on board the Standard was hoisted at the Maintopmasthead,
and the Red Standard with the anchor in it at the Foretopmasthead and
the Union Flag at the Mizentopmasthead.</p>

<p>Tuesday being 18.... The King had a Standard flying all night at y<sup>e</sup>
head of the Yacht's mast, the Queen had a Standard flying at the head of
the Prince's Main topmasthead Flaggstaff, and his R.H. the anchor Flagg
at the head of his Yacht's mast and Prince Rupert had the Union Flagg
at the head of his Yacht's mast....</p>

<p>Monday being 9th. (Sept. 1672).... This afternoon at 4 of the Clock the
King came on board, and Prince Rupert and several of the nobility were
with His Majesty. When His Majesty came within two miles of the Prince
his R.H. commanded the Standard to be struck until such time as his
Majesty came on board. At the striking of his R.H.'s Standard all the Flaggs
in the Fleet were struck immediately and kept down until the Standard on
board the Prince was hoisted, then they hoisted theirs.</p>

<h4><a name="Chapter_IVb" id="Chapter_IVb"></a><a href="#CONTENTS">(ii) THE ADMIRALTY FLAG</a></h4>

<p>The Admiralty Flag appears to have originated as a purely ornamental
flag displaying the official badge of the Lord High Admiral
for the decoration of his ship on ceremonial occasions. Its use for
such a purpose would be analogous with the display, in the fourteenth,
fifteenth and sixteenth centuries, of the royal badges, such as the
dragon, swan, antelope, portcullis, ostrich feather or rose.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span></p>

<p>The office of "Great" or "High" Admiral of England may be
dated from the appointment of John de Beauchamp as Admiral of all
the fleets, in 1360, but although the Anchor badge is found upon the
seals of the Lord Admirals of Scotland as early as 1515, no such early
instance has yet been brought to light in England<a name="FNanchor_239" id="FNanchor_239"></a><a href="#Footnote_239" class="fnanchor">[239]</a>. It may, however,
be presumed that it was in use south of the Tweed from an earlier
date, for the anchor was certainly in use in the sixteenth century as
a mark placed upon ships or goods arrested by the Admiralty Court.
The earliest known instance of the anchor in conjunction with the
English Lord High Admiral's arms occurs at the end of Queen Mary's
reign in a volume of Acts of the High Court of Admiralty dated
11th February, 1558. Here the arms of Lord Clinton and Saye are
surrounded by four anchors without cable<a name="FNanchor_240" id="FNanchor_240"></a><a href="#Footnote_240" class="fnanchor">[240]</a>.</p>

<p>For the earliest instance of the anchor in a flag we must turn to
the well-known engraving supposed to represent the 'Ark Royal,'
Howard's flagship in 1588, which shows an anchor in the head of a
streamer flown from the foretop<a name="FNanchor_241" id="FNanchor_241"></a><a href="#Footnote_241" class="fnanchor">[241]</a>.</p>

<p>The foul anchor<a name="FNanchor_242" id="FNanchor_242"></a><a href="#Footnote_242" class="fnanchor">[242]</a> is first found in the seal of Howard after he had
become Earl of Nottingham, and may be seen in a specimen attached
to a document dated April, 1601, now in the British Museum. The
badge appears on the reverse of this seal on the trappings of the horse
which the earl bestrides. In 1623 Buckingham, who had succeeded
Nottingham as Lord High Admiral, was provided with "an Ensigne
with ye L<sup>d</sup> Admiralls Badge &amp; Motto." This badge was evidently
the anchor and cable, for the badge of the foul anchor appears
prominently four times on the York Water Gate (Thames Embankment)
built for Buckingham in 1626, and in 1627 Buckingham was
using as his official seal the anchor and cable surrounded by the
garter and surmounted by a coronet. In the badges on the gate the
end of the cable hangs down over one of the arms, but in the seal
the end is neatly flemished down in three coils upon the shank.</p>

<p>In 1633, when Buckingham was dead and the Admiralty in commission,
the flags surveyed at Deptford included among them a silk
"red ensigne with ye Lo. Admiralls badge." At this date the badge
could not have been a personal one, and there seems no doubt that
it was the official anchor and cable, possibly of the same design as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>in Buckingham's seal, for the Commissioners had adopted this form
for use in their own seal, replacing the coronet and garter by the
legend "Sig. Com. Reg. Ma. Pro. Adm. Ang<a name="FNanchor_243" id="FNanchor_243"></a><a href="#Footnote_243" class="fnanchor">[243]</a>." It will be observed
that the field of this flag is red, as at the present day. The anchor
with coiled cable appears again during the Commonwealth on the seals
of the Generals at Sea, but the design had begun to deteriorate even
in Buckingham's time. In his seals in 1628 some of the turns of the
coil pass below the shank, and in the later seals the coil lays round the
shank instead of upon it.</p>

<p>When the Commission was dissolved in 1638 and the office granted
to the Earl of Northumberland (as substitute for the young Duke of
York), Northumberland adopted for his seal a design in which the cable
was draped in graceful turns as a border round the anchor, ending
at the ring on the side opposite to that at which it was made fast.
This design was used by the Committee of the Admiralty and Navy
under the Commonwealth and was adopted by James Duke of York
in 1660<a name="FNanchor_244" id="FNanchor_244"></a><a href="#Footnote_244" class="fnanchor">[244]</a>, but in the eighteenth century it in turn deteriorated, until
it reached the form used in the present flag<a name="FNanchor_245" id="FNanchor_245"></a><a href="#Footnote_245" class="fnanchor">[245]</a>, in which the cable is not
made fast to the anchor at all, but simply passes loosely through the
ring and hangs down stiffly on either side.</p>

<p>The anchor flag was not used during the Commonwealth, but it
was restored in 1661, when the contractor was paid £2. 10<i>s.</i> "ffor
shading the Standard and Ensigne and Jack with a ancor," £5. 10<i>s.</i>
"ffor sowing silke and cloth for the sockett and markeing the Ensigne
with the ancor and cable," and £4. 10<i>s.</i> "ffor sowing silke and cloth
for socketing &amp; markeing the flag with a ancor and cable<a name="FNanchor_246" id="FNanchor_246"></a><a href="#Footnote_246" class="fnanchor">[246]</a>."</p>

<p>The subordinate "badge" flag was now promoted to the dignity
of a "standard" and flown at the masthead as a substitute for the
royal standard when the Lord Admiral was unable to fly the latter,
because of the presence of the king in the fleet.</p>

<p>In 1673 the Test Act deprived the Duke of York of his office,
which for the next eleven years was placed in commission. Charles II,
just before his death, revoked the commission, and the office fell in
to the crown. When the Duke of York succeeded to the throne in
1685 as James II, he retained the office in his own hands, and in token
of this placed "a crown over the anchor as being himself his own
Admiral<a name="FNanchor_247" id="FNanchor_247"></a><a href="#Footnote_247" class="fnanchor">[247]</a>."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span></p>

<p>In addition to the anchor flag (which when used by the sovereign
is flown at the fore, as the main is already occupied by the royal
standard) a flag of similar design, but with the St George's cross in
the upper canton, was also flown as an ensign at the stern<a name="FNanchor_248" id="FNanchor_248"></a><a href="#Footnote_248" class="fnanchor">[248]</a></p>

<p>At this period, according to Lieut. Graydon's flag-book, the Scots
Lord Admiral flew a white flag containing a blue anchor and cable.
The Admiral of Scotland, who according to Pepys<a name="FNanchor_249" id="FNanchor_249"></a><a href="#Footnote_249" class="fnanchor">[249]</a> was "no officer
of State" and had "no precedence at all given him from his office,"
was abolished after the Union of 1707, when the three small ships
representing the navy of that country were absorbed in the English,
henceforth the British, fleet.</p>

<p>After the Revolution of 1688 the Office of Lord High Admiral
was placed in commission, but it was revived by William III in
June, 1702, when the Earl of Pembroke was appointed. Pembroke
had intended to proceed to sea in command of the fleet then being
fitted out in anticipation of the outbreak of the war with France and
Spain, known as the War of the Spanish Succession, and he would
have flown the royal standard in his flagship. William, however,
died on 8th March, and Queen Anne, immediately after her accession,
deprived the Lord High Admiral of the right to fly the standard,
among other perquisites and <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">droits</i>. Pembroke then gave instructions
for the anchor flag to be supplied instead. But as he was not a
seaman his proposal to take command of the fleet had naturally
aroused much opposition, and in the end it was dropped. In May he
was replaced as Lord High Admiral by Prince George of Denmark,
the Queen's consort, and although Pembroke again held the office
for a short time after the Prince's death in 1708, no opportunity
arose for the anchor flag to be flown at sea in military command
during his or the Prince's tenure.</p>

<div class="caption">PLATE VIII &mdash; Admirals' Flags</div>
</div>

<p class="p2" />
<p>In 1709 the office of Lord High Admiral was again placed in commission
and it remained in commission for over a hundred years.
During this period the anchor flag was on one occasion flown at sea
in executive command. At the end of March, 1719, Admiral the Earl
of Berkeley, then First Lord of the Admiralty, was appointed to the
command of a fleet then fitting out to repel a naval raid threatened
from Cadiz in support of the claims of the Pretender. Having been
given the extraordinary rank of "Admiral and Commander in Chief
of his Majesty's Navy and Fleets," he was authorised by the king
(George I) to fly the anchor flag at the main whilst so serving, and
the flag was in fact flown for a few weeks at the end of March and
beginning of April. The next occasion on which this flag was flown
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>in executive command at sea occurred in July, 1828, when the Duke
of Clarence (afterwards William IV), who had been appointed Lord
High Admiral in 1827, with the express understanding that he should
exercise no military command, suddenly put to sea from Plymouth,
flying the anchor flag, in command of a squadron of manoeuvre that
it had been intended to place under Vice-Admiral Sir Henry
Blackwood. This extraordinary escapade and the friction which had
been caused by the duke's method of conducting affairs, led to his
removal, and to the office being once more placed in commission.
It is very improbable that it will ever again be conferred upon an
individual. In May, and again in August, 1869, Mr Childers, the
First Lord, accompanied by Vice-Admiral Sir Sydney Dacres, the
First Sea Lord, embarked in H.M.S. 'Agincourt' and took command,
first of the reserve fleet, and then of an experimental squadron,
under the Admiralty flag. This proceeding gave rise to much comment,
but since the Letters Patent appointing a Board of Admiralty give
power to "any two or more" of the Commissioners to exercise all
the functions of the Lord High Admiral, the action of Mr Childers
does not seem to have been <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ultra vires</i>, though it is not one that is
likely to be repeated.</p>

<p>Since 1850 the anchor flag has been flown over the Admiralty
Office in London. At sea it is flown in the royal yacht when the
sovereign is present, in recognition of the fact that, under the Constitution,
he is the source from which the Lord High Admiral's
powers are derived; the anchor flag being flown at the fore, the
royal standard at the main, and the Union flag at the mizen. In
the Admiralty yacht the anchor flag is flown at the main when
members of the Board are embarked in her. It is the custom (a
custom that was in existence in the early years of the eighteenth
century) to fly the anchor flag on men-of-war during the ceremony
of launching. A similar flag, with the lower half of the field blue,
has been recently adopted as the flag of the Australian Naval
Board.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>And so the Admiral of a Fleet or Squadron hath his flag in the Main-top;
the Vice-Admiral in the Fore-top and the Rere Admiral in the
Missen-top, with the Crosses or Colours of their Nation and Countrymen,
And thus far it is usual and common even with Fleets of Merchant men,
agreeing amongst themselves for the Admiral<a name="FNanchor_250" id="FNanchor_250"></a><a href="#Footnote_250" class="fnanchor">[250]</a> ships in this kind.</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span></p>
<p>In these words Boteler, writing in 1634, sums up the method of
distinguishing the flags of the principal officers of a fleet which had
been made possible by the appearance of the three-masted ship of
war in the fifteenth century, was adopted by the English in the sixteenth,
and remained in vogue until the disappearance of the sailing
ship of war in the nineteenth century.</p>

<p>But, it may well be asked, what was done to distinguish the
admirals before ships had three masts? It is not easy to answer this
question, for the records throw no light on it and the information
vouchsafed by contemporary chroniclers is very scanty. Perhaps the
answer nearest the truth would be: "nothing, for there were then no
grades to distinguish." Before the sixteenth century there was rarely
more than one admiral in a fleet, and on those rare occasions on which
two or more admirals appear they were usually given the command
"jointly and severally," that is, as co-equals<a name="FNanchor_251" id="FNanchor_251"></a><a href="#Footnote_251" class="fnanchor">[251]</a>. In such cases it may
be presumed that both, if indeed they were not embarked in the same
ship, bore the St George's flag or royal standard at the masthead
and were distinguished by banners of their personal arms.</p>

<p>In the fleet that attempted invasion under Eustace the Monk in
1217, only one ship (that of the Commander-in-Chief) appears to have
flown a flag at the masthead, for we are told by a contemporary
chronicler<a name="FNanchor_252" id="FNanchor_252"></a><a href="#Footnote_252" class="fnanchor">[252]</a> that one of Hubert de Burgh's men agreed, when they
engaged Eustace's ship, "to climb up the mast and cut down the
banner, that the other vessels may be dispersed from want of a
leader."</p>

<p>In 1346 there seems to have been still only one flag of command
in a fleet. Edward III had in that year fitted out a fleet in order to
make an incursion into Gascony, but after a false start which had
been frustrated by contrary winds, the king, on the advice of
Godefroy de Harcourt, suddenly changed his mind and set out for
Normandy, taking the flag of command from his Admiral and leading
the fleet himself.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span></p>

<p>We have no further evidence as to the method of bearing admirals'
flags in the English fleet until we come to the "Book of Orders for
the War by Sea and Land<a name="FNanchor_255" id="FNanchor_255"></a><a href="#Footnote_255" class="fnanchor">[255]</a>," drawn up by Thos. Audley <em>c.</em> 1530 at
the request of Henry VIII. Here provision is made for only one
admiral, who is to bear two flags; one at the main and the other at
the fore, while all the other ships are to bear one at the mizen. The
orders drawn up by Lisle fifteen years later provide for a fleet
divided into three squadrons, and in this case also each admiral had
two flags, but here the two flags were necessary to distinguish the
flagships, as the private ships had each one flag, at the fore, main,
or mizen respectively, to denote the squadrons to which they belonged.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

</div>

<p>The relative dignity of the mastheads, main, fore and mizen, is
seen underlying this arrangement, for the Lord Admiral places his
standard at the main masthead and his St George, as next in rank,
at the masthead next in importance; the second admiral occupies the
two foremost mastheads with his flags and the third admiral the two
aftermost, each being, of course, in a four-masted ship.</p>

<p>It will be observed that there is as yet no mention of "Vice" or
"Rear" Admiral, but the term Vice-Admiral, which is much the
older of the two, was in use in the English fleet in 1547 and in the
French fleet at least as early as 1338. The term Rear-Admiral is more
modern. This is pointed out by Monson<a name="FNanchor_258" id="FNanchor_258"></a><a href="#Footnote_258" class="fnanchor">[258]</a>, but indeed sufficient proof
is to be seen in the fact that the term is not used in either the French
or Dutch navies<a name="FNanchor_259" id="FNanchor_259"></a><a href="#Footnote_259" class="fnanchor">[259]</a>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span></p>

<p>The Instructions drawn up in March, 1558, by Wm Wynter,
Admiral of a fleet of ships about to go to Portsmouth, contain "an
order for beringe of the flagge":</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Item that every Shippe of Warre do set up a flage of St. George uppon
her Bonaventure myson, excepte Mr. Broke, Captaine of the reed Gallie,
who is apointed to ware the flagge of vize Admyrall for this present

</div>

<p>Here the Vice-Admiral has but one flag, and although we are not
explicitly told where the Admiral and Vice-Admiral are to fly their
flags, it is evident that it is intended they should be at the main and
fore respectively.</p>

<p>We have no further definite information as to the mode in which
the junior admirals bore their flags until we reach the year 1596. For
the important expedition to Cadiz in the summer of that year a large
combined English and Dutch fleet was assembled, and was divided
into five squadrons; four English and one Dutch. The English ships
were under the command of the Earl of Essex and the Lord Admiral
(Howard) as "Joint Generalls of the Armies by sea and land." Under
them were Lord Thomas Howard as Vice-Admiral of the fleet and
Sir Walter Raleigh as Rear-Admiral. Each of these officers had command
of one of the English squadrons with a Vice- and a Rear-Admiral
of that squadron under him.</p>

<p>A contemporary account of the expedition among the Duke of
Northumberland's <span class="smcap">mss</span>.<a name="FNanchor_261" id="FNanchor_261"></a><a href="#Footnote_261" class="fnanchor">[261]</a> contains a series of coloured diagrams showing
the flags flown by the various Admirals. From these we see that
Howard, as Lord High Admiral, flew the royal standard at the main
and the St George at the fore. The Vice- and Rear-Admirals of his
squadron flew, at the fore and mizen respectively, a flag with striped
field (red, white and blue in seven horizontal stripes) and the
St George in the canton. Essex, although superior to Howard in
social rank and named before him in the joint proclamation which
they issued, flew only the St George at the main. The Vice- and
Rear-Admirals of his squadron flew at the fore the St George barred
with blue horizontally.</p>

<p>The Vice-Admiral of the fleet flew the St George at the fore, and
at the main, as Admiral of his squadron, a flag with the St George
in a canton and a field striped horizontally green and white. The
Vice- and Rear-Admirals of this squadron flew a similar flag at their
proper mastheads. The Rear-Admiral of the fleet flew the St George
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>at the mizen, and he and the Vice- and Rear-Admirals of his squadron
flew plain white flags at the main, fore, and mizen respectively. The
squadronal flags of the first three squadrons as depicted in this manuscript
are unique as admirals' flags; they appear to have been stern
ensigns promoted for this special occasion.</p>

<p>Originally it had been intended to use plain flags of different
colours for the four squadrons, as is shown by the following entry
in the Navy Accounts to which Mr Oppenheim drew attention in his
<cite>Administration of the Royal Navy</cite>.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

</div>

<p>Apart from the fact that "the unusual particularity of the item
suggests that it was thought to require some justification, which
would be natural if the flags referred to had never been used<a name="FNanchor_263" id="FNanchor_263"></a><a href="#Footnote_263" class="fnanchor">[263]</a>," it
may be pointed out that ten squadronal flags were needed, while
this item only refers to four. There is, moreover, another entry in
the same account which gives the sizes and prices of the "Ensignes
&amp; fflagges" provided for the expedition, at a total cost of £371. 8<i>s.</i> 4<i>d.</i>
Descriptions of these flags are unfortunately not given, but it is a
significant fact that of the largest size, sixteen breadths<a name="FNanchor_264" id="FNanchor_264"></a><a href="#Footnote_264" class="fnanchor">[264]</a>, ten were
supplied.</p>

<p>The reason for the abandonment of the original intention to use
plain-coloured flags for the squadrons of the 1596 expedition is not
known, but when, in 1625, another expedition was sent out against
Cadiz the fleet was divided into three squadrons, each under three
admirals, with red, blue, and white flags respectively.</p>

<p>This expedition set sail in October, 1625, but four months earlier
a much smaller fleet, also divided into three squadrons, had been
sent to conduct the Queen from Boulogne to England. The difference
in the Admirals' flags worn on these two occasions is significant, for
it shows that there was no established practice applicable to large
fleets.</p>

<p>The Instructions<a name="FNanchor_265" id="FNanchor_265"></a><a href="#Footnote_265" class="fnanchor">[265]</a> issued by Buckingham in June for the Boulogne
fleet provide that the Admiral shall wear the Union flag at the main,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>and each ship of his squadron a pendant at the main masthead. The
Vice- and Rear-Admirals are to have the Union at the fore and mizen
respectively, and the private ships<a name="FNanchor_266" id="FNanchor_266"></a><a href="#Footnote_266" class="fnanchor">[266]</a> of their squadrons pendants at
those mastheads.</p>

<p>But when the larger fleet was set forth in October each of its
three squadrons had three flag officers. The instructions issued by
the Commander-in-Chief, Sir Edward Cecil (afterwards Lord
Wimbledon) on 3rd October, contained the following provision:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>17. The whole fleet is to be divided into three squadrons: the admiral's
squadron is to wear red flags and red pendants on the main topmasthead;
the vice-admiral's squadron to wear blue flags and blue pendants on the
fore topmasthead; the rear admiral's squadron to wear white flags and
white pendants on the mizen topmast heads.</p>
</div>

<p>The wording of this instruction is somewhat ambiguous. Owing
to the absence of a comma after "flags," it may be taken to read that
every ship was to have both a flag and a pendant in one of the three
tops, but this would leave no ready means of distinguishing the flag-ships.
Monson and Boteler, who wrote shortly after this date, say
that the squadrons of a fleet were distinguished by coloured pendants
hung from the main, fore, and mizen tops respectively<a name="FNanchor_267" id="FNanchor_267"></a><a href="#Footnote_267" class="fnanchor">[267]</a>, so that we
may conclude that the arrangement of flags on this occasion was as
follows:</p>

<p>The Admiral commanding in chief, although he was not Lord
High Admiral, flew the royal standard at the main.</p>

<p>The Vice- and Rear-Admirals of his squadron flew "a redd flagg
with a little white, and St George's Crosse therein at the topp of the
flaggstaff<a name="FNanchor_268" id="FNanchor_268"></a><a href="#Footnote_268" class="fnanchor">[268]</a>" (i.e. a red flag with St George in the upper canton next
the staff, as in the red ensign), while the private ships of this squadron
flew red pendants at the main.</p>

<p>The Vice-Admiral of the fleet and the Vice-Admiral and Rear-Admiral
of his squadron bore plain blue flags at the appropriate
mastheads, and the private ships of this squadron wore blue pendants
at the fore topmast head.</p>

<p>The Rear-Admiral of the fleet and the Vice- and Rear-Admirals
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>of his squadron had white flags
<a name="FNanchor_269" id="FNanchor_269"></a><a href="#Footnote_269" class="fnanchor">[269]</a>, while the private ships of this
squadron had white pendants at the mizen topmast head.</p>

<p>No mention is made of the Union flag, which should normally
have been flown by the Vice-Admiral and Rear-Admiral of the fleet
at the fore and mizen respectively, but as "every flag officer both of
the fleet and of the squadrons was a soldier<a name="FNanchor_270" id="FNanchor_270"></a><a href="#Footnote_270" class="fnanchor">[270]</a>" anomalies were to be
expected. Sir Francis Stewart, the original Rear-Admiral of the fleet,
and the only seaman among the flag officers, was left on shore at the
last moment because his ship, the 'Lion,' was found to be leaky.
Wimbledon sent for his flag and conferred it on Denbigh, the Vice-Admiral
of his squadron. Denbigh's former place was given to
Delaware, the Rear-Admiral of the second, or blue squadron. This
naturally gave offence to the Vice-Admirals of the second and third
squadrons, and a furious squabble arose, which only interests us in
two points so far as the flags were concerned. One is that in the course
of the squabble the red flag, which became the object of contention,
is referred to repeatedly as the "flag of St George," the other is that
in a weak attempt at a solution of the difficulty created by his action
Wimbledon authorised Valentia, the Vice-Admiral of the blue squadron
to</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="no-indent">carrie the redd flagg with the St George's Cross in the maine topp as a
kind of extraordinary or cheife deputy or Vice Admirall to the Admirall
or to his Squadron, soe to distinguish him from my Lo. Delaware with
some preferment alsoe to my Lord of Valencia.</p>
</div>

<p class="no-indent">A few days later Wimbledon requested him "to weare his flagg no
longer in the maine topp," and finally both Valentia and Delaware
"for reasons best known to themselves took downe their flagges."
The whole episode forms a truly comic opera performance that must
have greatly amused, if it did not disgust, the seamen of the fleet.</p>

<p>The main interest in this miserable expedition lies in the fact that
it was the first occasion of the division of the fleet into red, blue, and
white squadrons.</p>

<p>Two years later an expedition was fitted out under the command
of Buckingham, the Lord High Admiral, intended for the capture
of the Ile de Ré. On this occasion, in addition to the main fleet, which
was again divided into red, blue, and white squadrons under three
principal officers:&mdash;the Lord Admiral, with the standard at the main;
the Vice-Admiral, with the Union at the fore and a blue flag at the
main; and a Rear-Admiral, with the Union at the mizen and a white
flag at the main, each of these having a Vice- and Rear-Admiral under
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>him&mdash;there were two subsidiary squadrons, one under Lord Denbigh,
who flew the St George at the main, and the other under Sir John
Pennington, who flew the St Andrew's cross at the main, the only
occasion on which the Scots' flag has been flown by an admiral of an
English fleet.</p>

<p>The method of bearing Admirals' flags now became regularised.
If the fleet was small and had only three flag officers, the senior flew
the Union flag at the main&mdash;unless he were the Lord Admiral, or
had special permission to fly the standard&mdash;and the other two flew
the Union at the fore and mizen respectively. If the fleet were larger
the number of flag officers, who, it must be remembered, had as yet
no permanent tenure of the rank, was increased to nine and the fleet
was divided into squadrons distinguished by the red, blue and white
flags of their Admirals and by the corresponding pendants of the
ships; but this distinction of colour did not as yet extend to the
ensigns on the poop.</p>

<p>This arrangement persisted until the end of the reign of Charles I,
but in the first great fleet fitted out by the Commonwealth, at the
beginning of the First Dutch War, the precedence of the colours
was changed. As already related, the standard and Union flag flown
by the principal admirals had been replaced by flags containing the
cross and harp, but from the following proposals referred by the
Commissioners for the Admiralty and Navy to their subordinate
Board, the Navy Commissioners, it will be seen that it had been at
first intended to adhere to the order of colours&mdash;red, blue, white.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The 3 Generals to weare each of them a Standard, the one to have a

<div class="caption">PLATE IX &mdash; Early Ensigns, etc.</div>

<p class="p2" />
<p>The arrangements here proposed merit attention, for they contain
several departures from the custom hitherto prevailing. The
three principal admirals, being of co-equal authority, are each to fly
the same standard at the main masthead, but to distinguish them
they are to have pendants and ensigns of three different colours. The
Vice- and Rear-Admiral of the fleet are retained, but they no longer
have separate squadrons, the senior becomes Vice-Admiral to the
first, or red squadron, and the junior, Vice-Admiral of the second,
or blue squadron. To these are added a squadronal or "occasional"
Vice-Admiral for the third or white squadron, and three Rear-Admirals,
one for each squadron. The private ships are to have an
ensign, as well as the customary pendant, of the squadronal colour.</p>

<p>The Navy Commissioners, after remarking upon rates of pay
suitable to the various grades of flag officers, confess their incompetence
to advise about the flags. "As to the distinguishment of
weareing the fflaggs, Pendants and Ensignes, wee are not capable to
give our advice therein, but must leave it to those Comand<sup>rs</sup> at Sea
(whoe best knowe the causes of such kind of distinctions) to advise."</p>

<p>This was on the 14th January, 1653, but in the order to hasten
the supply of flags to the fleet dated 4th February these flags are
named in the order red, white, and blue. The reason for the change
is not known, but it may be remarked that the white escutcheon of
England had precedence of the blue escutcheon of Ireland in the
Generals' standard, and this may have led the Generals at Sea to
change the order of precedence of the squadronal colours.</p>

<p>On the 18th February the fleet came into collision with the Dutch
at the Battle of Portland. On that occasion Blake and Deane, two of
the original Generals at Sea, were embarked together in the flagship
of the Red Squadron, which flew the standard, but Monck, who had
recently been appointed as the third General in the vacancy caused
by the death of Popham, took command of the White Squadron,
while Penn, the Vice-Admiral of the fleet, commanded the Blue.
The Admiral's flags, other than the standard, were "clear" colours,
in other words plain flags, but the pendants and ensigns all had "a
red cross in chief." The Vice- and the Rear-Admiral of the Fleet,
who acted as Admiral of the Blue and Vice-Admiral of the Red
respectively, probably flew, in addition to their plain blue and red
flags, the Commonwealth "Union" flag of the cross and harp, but
about this time the latter flag seems to have lost its red and yellow<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
border and to have been of the same form as the "Jack." Thus in an
order dated 2nd March for a further supply of flags to be hastened
to the fleet, then re-fitting for a renewal of the conflict, these flags
are described as "of ye Jack colours<a name="FNanchor_272" id="FNanchor_272"></a><a href="#Footnote_272" class="fnanchor">[272]</a>."</p>

<p>At the Restoration the standard and jack flags reverted to the
forms in use before 1649. The existing method of displaying the
admirals' flags and the precedence of the squadronal colours remained
unaltered, but a more strict regulation of their use gradually makes
itself felt, and precise instructions as to the wearing of their flags
begin to appear in the commissions of appointment issued to the flag
officers. This was no doubt the logical outcome of the improved
methods of naval administration, and especially of such improvements
in the status of officers as the establishment of "Half-pay,"
of the introduction into the fleet of suitable youths with the express
purpose of training them as officers, and the institution of qualifying
tests before promotion to the rank of lieutenant. All these reforms
tended to make the navy a regular profession for its higher officers
instead of a mere haphazard calling, but it must be remembered that
as yet the only established "Flag" ranks were those of Lord Admiral
and Vice- and Rear-Admiral of England (or "of the Fleet"). All
other Admirals were only "occasional," and officers holding such
"occasional" rank yielded up the dignity on hauling down their flag
and may frequently be found serving later as simple "Captain."</p>

<p>An important step forward was made in recognising that there
might be two or more ships in company without either of them
necessarily becoming an "Admiral" ship. This led to the institution
in 1674 of the "Distinction-Pendant," which will be discussed in
detail later. (See Broad Pendant, <a href="#Page_102">p. 102</a>.)</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span></p>

<p>When the Revolution of 1688 put an end to Pepys' activities at
the Admiralty he was engaged in codifying the regulations relating
to flags, and had laid before the king (as Lord High Admiral) a "new
establishment" under which "no flags are to be issued but by particular
warrant, which I suppose is to express their no., colors, and
dimensions according to the occasions which they are issued for<a name="FNanchor_274" id="FNanchor_274"></a><a href="#Footnote_274" class="fnanchor">[274]</a>."</p>

<p>The position at the end of Pepys' career is well summarised in
the table overleaf drawn up by him&mdash;one of the many instances of
his fondness for methodical statements.</p>

<p>The last entry is of especial interest. When the stricter regulation
enforced had prevented many officers from wearing flags who would,
in similar circumstances, undoubtedly have had that privilege in the
first half of the century, much importance was attached to the right
to exhibit a naked flagstaff. One striking instance of this occurs in
1687, when Sir Roger Strickland was appointed Vice-Admiral of the
fleet under the Duke of Grafton, ordered to transport the Queen
of Portugal (the king's sister) to Lisbon. Strickland, not unnaturally,
wanted to wear a flag as Vice-Admiral. Not many years earlier he
would have done this as a matter of course; now he had to obtain
the king's permission, which was granted. But he had omitted Pepys
from his reckoning. The king's sign manual warrant was accompanied
by a long letter from Pepys dissuading him from exercising
the right:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="no-indent">a thing so extraordinary, so irregular, and so unjustified by any practice
past, and unlikely to be ever imitated in time to come, as this which you
have thus contended for, of having two of the Top Flags of England
exposed to sea, in view of the two greatest Rivalls of England for Sea
Dominion and Glory (I mean the Dutch and French) with no better provision
for supporting the Honour thereof, then Six Ships, and two of them
such as carry not above 190 men and 54 guns between them, and this too
obtained through meer force of Importunity,</p>
</div>

<p class="no-indent">and hinting that the king will take it well if he does not hoist the
flag, though he may bear the flagstaff. Like a wise man, he took
Mr Secretary's hint, and resigned the honour. The king thereupon
authorised Strickland to bear the naked staff only, and informed that
officer that he was pleased to find that Pepys' advice had been taken,
for it had been offered with his privity.</p>

<p>Although Pepys' influence ceased at the Revolution, and his proposed
"establishment" of flags was never ratified, the work of regulation
and restriction went on through the reigns of William and
Mary and Anne, culminating in the abolition of the Lord Admiral's
standard and the confining of the Union flag at the masthead to the
"Admiral of the Fleet." Nevertheless, several curious anomalies remained
until the opening years of the eighteenth century. Officers
appointed to the chief command of squadrons sent to the Mediterranean
or West Indies were, whatever their rank, usually authorised
to wear the Union flag at the main so soon as they had left the Channel.
Thus in 1690 Captain Lawrence Wright was authorised to wear the
Union flag at the main when sent to the West Indies in command of
a small squadron.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Whereas his Ma<sup>tie</sup> thinks fitting for his Service that in ye present Employment

<p>The position occupied by Captain Wright was equivalent to that
for which, at a later date, the title "Commodore" was borrowed
from the Dutch. The Distinction Pendant, which it might be thought
would be more applicable to such cases, was as yet confined in its
use to the Downs. Ten months later Captain Aylmer was sent to the
Mediterranean in a similar position, but instead of being allowed the
Union flag he was only granted a special distinction pendant with
the Union instead of the St George's cross at the head. Cases in
which captains were ordered to wear the Union flag at the main are
rare, but junior flag officers in command of squadrons were, during
the reigns of William III and Anne, frequently directed to wear the
Union flag as though they were full admirals. Thus Sir George Rooke,
when appointed Commander-in-Chief in February, 1693, of a fleet
destined for the Mediterranean was instructed:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>12. So soone as you shalbe out of ye English Channell in your voyage
outwards bound, you are to wear the Union Flag at ye Mainetopmast head
and to continue so to do untill in your returne you shalbe againe in the

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span></p>

<p class="no-indent">At that date Rooke was Vice-Admiral of the Red, and flew, while in

<p>Early in 1702 an important alteration was made in the white
squadronal colours, which led to the introduction of the St George's
cross in the admiral's flag and in the fly of the ensign. It will be
remembered that hitherto the white colours consisted of: (1) a plain
white flag for the admirals; (2) a plain white ensign with a small
St George's cross in the upper canton next the staff; (3) a plain white
pendant with a St George's cross at the head. In February, 1702,
the Earl of Pembroke, then Lord High Admiral, sent the Navy
Board instructions for fitting out the fleet intended to operate against
the French; these instructions included:</p>

</div>

<p>The white admirals' flag was to be replaced by the Union, and the
white ensign by a red one with a broad white horizontal stripe
through it. The reason for some such change is obvious when we
recollect that at this date the French flag was white. Six weeks later
were given the further directions that had been promised "suddenly."
After cancelling the order for the standard, as already related<a name="FNanchor_278" id="FNanchor_278"></a><a href="#Footnote_278" class="fnanchor">[278]</a>,
Pembroke instructs the Navy Board:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>And whereas it may be necessary to distinguish the Vice and Rear
Adm<sup>ll</sup> of each squadron by some particular mark in the fflaggs which they
carry in the heads of their Boats, I do hereby desire and direct you to cause
the distinctions exprest in ye papers herewith sent you to be made in the
Flaggs which the respective Vice and Rear Adm<sup>lls</sup> shall be furnished with
for the Boats as aforesaid: as also that what Pendents there shall now or
for the future be wanting for the Fleet, be made somewhat broader than

<p>The need for some distinction in the flags of the admirals of the
same squadronal colour, when displayed in a boat, or indeed any
small craft in which only one position was available, must, one would
suppose, have been felt often before, but this was the first attempt
to solve the difficulty. Its main interest lies in the fact that it supplied
the solution of the similar difficulty which arose, nearly three hundred
years later, when the three-masted sailing-ship had given place to
the two-masted iron ship, which often had only a single masthead
available for the Admiral's flag.</p>

<p>The changes promulgated by the orders of the 5th February and
the 20th March, 1702, already quoted, did not end there, for the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>officers of the fleet were not satisfied with an arrangement that made
over the Union flag to the admirals of the second squadron of the
fleet and introduced a red and white ensign. Accordingly, on the 6th
of May, Pembroke issued the following further order:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Whereas I did some time since direct in what manner the Flaggs and
Ensignes should be made for such ships as should be appointed to be of
the Squadron of the Adm<sup>l</sup> of the White, and whereas upon consulting with
the Flagg Officers of the Fleet, it is thought more advisable that the said
Flaggs and Ensignes should be rather made white with a large St George's
Cross, according to the sample herewith sent you: and I do therefore
hereby desire and direct you, to cause all such of the said Flaggs and Ensignes
as have already been made by your orders to be altered, and that
such as are still to be made be conformable to what is before directed, as
also the Flaggs necessary for the Boats of the Ships of the aforesaid Squadron<a name="FNanchor_281" id="FNanchor_281"></a><a href="#Footnote_281" class="fnanchor">[281]</a>.</p>
</div>

<p>The drawing included with the order shows a very broad red
cross, in width equal to one-third of the depth of the whole flag<a name="FNanchor_282" id="FNanchor_282"></a><a href="#Footnote_282" class="fnanchor">[282]</a>.</p>

<p>This alteration necessitated a change in the boat flags of the Vice-
and Rear-Admirals of the White. The balls became blue and were
gathered into the upper canton instead of being placed diagonally
across the flag; the white balls in the red and blue flags also underwent
the same alteration in position.</p>

<p>In November, 1805, as a special compliment to the navy, the
rank of Admiral of the Red was created. As this introduced three
red flags in place of two, the boats' flags of the Vice- and Rear-Admiral
of the Red were altered so as to have the same number of
balls as the other Vice- and Rear-Admirals.</p>

<p>No further alteration took place in the Admirals' flags until 1864,
when the division of Flag Officers into the three categories "of the
Red," "of the White," and "of the Blue" was abolished and the
squadronal colours discontinued. The reason for this change will be
discussed in dealing with "Flags of Distinction," and it will therefore
be sufficient to note here that the white colours were retained for the
navy, red balls being substituted for blue in the "boat" flags.</p>

<p>The invention of the modern battleship, with only two masts (one
of which was often unfitted for the display of the Admiral's flag owing
to the presence of a masthead semaphore) had caused the general
adoption by Vice- and Rear-Admirals of the "boat" form of their
flags instead of the plain flag at the fore or mizen respectively, and
this led to the question being raised in 1898 of a suitable flag for
Vice- and Rear-Admirals, who often found the main masthead alone
available for their flag, while on the contrary an Admiral was, in other
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>ships, often obliged to hoist his on the foremast. In view of the fact
that many of the great maritime nations had adopted the British
method of differencing by balls (or stars) it was not thought desirable
to abandon this method, but to make the flags more easily distinguishable
the balls were increased in size to one-half of the depth of the
canton, which necessitated placing the second ball of the Rear-Admiral
in the lower canton next the staff, instead of in the upper one.</p>

<p>With the arrangement then adopted, which clearly distinguishes
the flags of the three grades in all conceivable circumstances, we may
assume that finality has been reached.</p>

<h5>(<em>a</em>) <i>The Commodore's Broad Pendant</i></h5>

<p>Although the use of a specially large pendant to denote the presence
of the officer in command of a squadron was not unknown in
early days<a name="FNanchor_283" id="FNanchor_283"></a><a href="#Footnote_283" class="fnanchor">[283]</a>, the custom was not adopted in the English fleet until the
latter part of the seventeenth century. Introduced first in 1674 simply
to denote the ship of the officer in command for the time being of
that important roadstead the Downs, the natural rendezvous of all
ships going to and from the Thames and Medway, the custom was
extended in 1690 to embrace the case in which a small squadron was
sent abroad under a captain for whom there was no room on a Flag
List which had become restricted to the nine admirals of the red,
white, and blue colours.</p>

<p>On 14th November, 1674, in the course of a debate by the King
and the Admiralty Board concerning the flying of pendants by
foreign men-of-war in the Downs, the question was raised as to the
desirability of marking the ship of the officer in command there,
when that officer was not of flag rank. The summary of this discussion,
recorded by Pepys in the Admiralty "Journal," contains so
many points of interest that it seems desirable to reproduce it in full.</p>

up, or cause it to be taken downe; and it being, upon discourse thereon,
observed first that Pendants originally were not at all designed as a mark
or distinction, but only ornament. Next, That at this day ye weareing of
a Pendant at ye Maintopp is yt which is everywhere become ye Marke of
distinguishing a Man of Warr from a Merch<sup>t</sup> man. Thirdly, That our
Ensigns and Jacke, together with their lyeing in ye Adm<sup>ls</sup> Birth, will
sufficiently informe as well straingers as his Ma<sup>ts</sup> Subjects which is ye
Comand<sup>r</sup> in Cheife without ye helpe of ye Pendants, soe as noe mistake
can arise from ye want of it either on occasion of applications to be made or
respect to be paid to her. Lastly, That noe difficulty has at any time heretofore
been made of permitting Straingers Men of Warr to weare their
Pendants in presence of ye Comand<sup>r</sup> in Cheife in ye Downes, noe more
than elsewhere. The respect challenged by his Mat<sup>y</sup> lying not in ye lowreing
of ye Pendant but ye fflagg or Topsaile which was now avered by Mr Vice
Chamberlaine and S<sup>r</sup> Jeremy Smith, as it had lately been to Mr Pepys by
ye body of ye Trinity House of whom hee had on this occasion lately
inquired after the knowledge and observation of ye Eldest Seamen there.
Whereupon it was resolved by his Mat<sup>y</sup> and their Lord<i>ps</i>, that ye loureing
of ye Pendant and kepeing of it downe is not in this case to be exacted,
and y<sup>t</sup> Capt Dickinson should be accordingly directed therein, But in case
upon further inquiry into this matter (w<sup>ch</sup> Mr Pepys was ordered to make
w<sup>th</sup> ye Off<sup>rs</sup> of the Navy) it should be found needfull (with respect either to
decency or use) that some distinction be observed betweene his Ma<sup>ts</sup> Ship
Commanding in Cheife (and not beareing a Flagg) and others of his Ma<sup>ts</sup>
Ships or his Subjects rideing in ye Downes at ye same time, some convenient
marke or distinction be by them Propounded to his Ma<sup>ty</sup> &amp; my Lords
on that behalfe in order to their further determination thereon.</p>
</div>

<p>On the 18th Pepys sent the Navy Board a memorandum</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="no-indent">to put them in mind of considering how far it may be necessary for the
ship which shall command in chief there, and which from her quality and
the saving of charge shall not be allowed to wear a flag, be appointed to
bear some mark of difference, and if so what may be proper to be established
without exposing the King to the extraordinary charge of a flag<a name="FNanchor_284" id="FNanchor_284"></a><a href="#Footnote_284" class="fnanchor">[284]</a>.</p>
</div>

<p>After a week's consideration the Navy Board replied that</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="no-indent">in case the evills that may arise from the want of this distinction are such
as shalbee thought necessary to bee prevented, wee doe humbly acquaint
yo<sup>r</sup> Lo<sup>pps</sup> that in our opinion severall inconveniences fitt to be prevented
may accrew in case severall of his Ma<sup>ties</sup> Shipps doe at one and the same
tyme ride in the Downes and it bee not knowne which of the said shipps
doeth command there in cheife<a name="FNanchor_285" id="FNanchor_285"></a><a href="#Footnote_285" class="fnanchor">[285]</a>.</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span></p>

<p class="no-indent">They therefore humbly conceived it expedient to appoint, as a mark
of distinction, a Red Pendant, somewhat larger than ordinary, on a
small flagstaff at the main topmast head. With a view to saving expense
they were careful to suggest that the</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="no-indent">Flaggstaff &amp; Pendant when the shipp by whome it was worne happens to
leave the Downes shall bee delivered to such other shipp there as shall bee
appointed to succeed in the roome of the former, or if there bee noe such
shipp there, then that the same bee sent on shore to Deale and lodged
there with his Ma<sup>ties</sup> Muster Master<a name="FNanchor_286" id="FNanchor_286"></a><a href="#Footnote_286" class="fnanchor">[286]</a></p>
</div>

<p class="no-indent">until it was again wanted. Their fear that they might have to supply
every likely ship with a staff and distinction pendant is perhaps the
reason of the hesitating reluctance which their letter displays.</p>

<p>The Admiralty approved their proposals, and on the 12th December
issued the necessary order, being careful to add that it was done
"without any extra wages to be allowed for the same<a name="FNanchor_287" id="FNanchor_287"></a><a href="#Footnote_287" class="fnanchor">[287]</a>."</p>

<p>The arrangement seems to have been viewed with some apathy
by those concerned, probably because there were no extra wages
attached, for in June, 1676, Pepys wrote to his brother-in-law, the
Muster Master at Deal, reminding him that it was his duty to see
the order complied with, and at the same time informing Captain
Sir R. Robinson, then Commander-in-Chief in the Downs:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>I am to note to you that his Majesty's last orders authorised you to wear
the pendant of distinction which was some time since established ... the
wearing which pendant I fear hath been for some time neglected, but the
King's said orders will remedy it by your calling for it from his Agent at
Deal and putting it up according to the establishment ... which will abundantly
I hope distinguish you<a name="FNanchor_288" id="FNanchor_288"></a><a href="#Footnote_288" class="fnanchor">[288]</a>.</p>
</div>

<p>Pepys in his <cite>Miscellanea</cite> has given us a drawing and description
of this pendant, from which it appears that it had the St George's
cross in a white field in chief and was five breadths (4 ft 7 ins.)
broad at the head, and 21 yards in length, whereas the ordinary
pendants were only three breadths (2 ft 9 ins.) at the head and
varied in length from 22 to 32 yards according to the size of the ship.
Both were "swallow-tailed" (i.e. slit at the end of the fly).</p>

<p>In 1683 the Navy Board had again to be reminded that this distinction
pendant was to be used, but by 1692 it had become so popular
that "some Commanders of their Ma<sup>ts</sup> ships do take the liberty
to wear distinction pendants without order for the same<a name="FNanchor_289" id="FNanchor_289"></a><a href="#Footnote_289" class="fnanchor">[289]</a>," and they
were strictly forbidden to do so.</p>

<p>In 1695 the use of this pendant was extended to the senior captain
of ships cruising in the "Soundings" at the entrance to the Channel.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span></p>

<p>In the meantime another form of distinction pendant was introduced,
in which the St George at the head was replaced by the
Union. This form was for use abroad, in analogy with the practice
by which Admirals sent abroad were ordered to wear the Union flag
when out of the Channel, instead of their squadronal flag. As early
as 1687 Pepys had noted the use abroad of a red ensign with the
Union instead of the St George in its canton. At this date the
St George's flag was still being flown by Genoese ships, and it was
doubtless the desire to avoid any misunderstandings on this account
that led to the disuse, before 1707, of the St George's flag by English
men-of-war outside home waters. For some unexplained reason this
form of ensign had become known as the Budgee flag, and this name
was later transferred to the Union Broad Pendant, which became
known as the Budgee Pendant<a name="FNanchor_290" id="FNanchor_290"></a><a href="#Footnote_290" class="fnanchor">[290]</a> and was no doubt the parent of the
modern word "Burgee."</p>

<p>The first instance of the use of the Budgee Pendant occurs in
December, 1690, when Captain Aylmer, appointed Commander-in-Chief
of the squadron intended for the Mediterranean, was ordered
to be supplied with a distinction pendant "made with ye Union
Crosses in place where other Distinction Pendants have only
St Georges Crosse<a name="FNanchor_291" id="FNanchor_291"></a><a href="#Footnote_291" class="fnanchor">[291]</a>."</p>

<p>Three years later the Earl of Danby, Captain of the 'Royal
William' in the fleet under the three joint-admirals, was ordered to
wear this same pendant and given precedence next to the Flag
Officers<a name="FNanchor_292" id="FNanchor_292"></a><a href="#Footnote_292" class="fnanchor">[292]</a>, and in 1697 Captain J. Norris was appointed Commander-in-Chief
of a squadron bound to Newfoundland and ordered, when
out of the Channel, to "wear such a swallow tail pendant as
Mr Aylmer had when he commanded a squadron in the streights,
and which was afterwards worne by the Earle of Danby<a name="FNanchor_293" id="FNanchor_293"></a><a href="#Footnote_293" class="fnanchor">[293]</a>."</p>

<p>All these officers, whether commanding-in-chief like Aylmer or
in subordinate command like Danby, were serving in a position
afterwards known as that of "Commodore." This title, derived from
the Dutch "Commandeur" (originally the senior officer of a merchant
fleet) which had been adopted in the Dutch navy from their merchant
service at the end of the sixteenth century, was introduced into the
English navy about 1695, no doubt as a consequence of the close
connection between the two navies under "Dutch William." It was,
however, not yet officially recognised; in their official orders the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>officers were simply "Captain" or "Captain and Commander in
chief." They received a special allowance, usually 10<i>s.</i> a day, while
so acting. Later on the importance of some of these positions was
enhanced by the introduction, in certain cases, of a second captain
into the Commodore's ship. This practice, which was in vogue at
least as early as 1720, does not seem at first to have entailed any
difference in flag or pay, but it made an important difference in prize
money, for those Commodores who had Captains under them were
treated in this respect as though they were flag officers.</p>

<p>In 1731 the Admiralty attempted to establish the rank of Commodore
by providing for three posts of this rank in the <cite>Regulations
and Instructions for his Majesty's service at sea</cite>, then for the first time
gathered together in one book, but the Privy Council struck out all
the articles relating to this proposal before recommending the book
for the king's approval. The title was, however, formally recognised
in 1734 by an Order in Council which, in laying down the relative
precedence of Sea and Land Officers, provided "That Commodores
with Broad Pendants have the same respects as Brigadiers-General,"
but the rank remains to this day a "temporary" one, carrying special
pay and privileges but giving the captain holding it no authority over
captains senior to him on the list.</p>

<p>Regulations governing the rank first appeared in the <cite>King's Regulations</cite>
of 1806. The Broad Pendant was to be of the squadronal
colour and was to have the further distinction of a white ball if the
Commodore had no second captain in his ship.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>There shall be a temporary rank of Commodore which shall be distinguished
by a Broad Pendant, Red, White or Blue....</p>

<p>If the Commodore commands the ship himself the Pendant shall
have a large white Ball near the staff and he shall not rank as a Rear
Admiral.</p>
</div>

<p>Prior to 1806, Commodores appear to have kept their pendants
flying in all circumstances. The new regulations, however, directed
that if the Commodore met a senior captain, that captain was also
to hoist a broad pendant, but if there were more than one senior
to him then the Commodore was to strike his broad pendant
instead.</p>

<p>This anomalous arrangement was altered in the Regulations of
1824, which provided that no Commodore should fly his broad
pendant, or even hold the rank, while in the presence of a senior
captain; but the difference in the two positions, dependant on the
presence or absence of a second captain in the commodore's ship,
was accentuated by dividing the commodores into two distinct<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
classes on this basis; the first class flying the red or white pendant
and the second the blue only.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>A plain Red Broad Pendant, or a White Broad Pendant with a Red
Cross in it, is to be worn by Commodores of the First Class; but when
more than one such Commodore shall be present, the Senior only shall
wear the Red Pendant, and the other, or others, the White Pendant.</p>

<p>A Blue Pendant is to be worn by Commodores of the Second Class.</p>
</div>

<p>With the abolition of the squadronal colours in 1864, the red and
blue broad pendants disappeared. Commodores of the first class were
to wear the white broad pendant at the main and those of the second
class the same pendant at the fore. In boats the latter were to have a
red ball in the upper canton of their pendants. From the same cause
as that which affected the admirals' flags, this form with the ball soon
became the only one in use for the second class.</p>

<p>Originally fourteen times as long as it was wide at the head, the
broad pendant became gradually shorter. By the time the red and
blue forms were abandoned it had reached its present proportions,
in which it is only twice as long as its greatest breadth.</p>

<p>In 1913 the provision that Commodores should strike their broad
pendant while in the presence of a senior captain was deleted from
the <cite>King's Regulations</cite>. Commodores take rank and command of
each other according to their seniority as captains and without regard
to the class to which they belong, so that a Second Class Commodore
flying a Broad Pendant with a ball might be the superior officer of
a First Class Commodore flying the pendant without the ball, normally
the superior flag, and the relative precedence of these flags
would thereby become inverted while these two Commodores were
in company or in the same port.</p>

<h5>(<em>b</em>) <i>The Senior Officers' Pendant</i></h5>

<p>Ten years after the institution of the Distinction Pendant to denote
a Commander-in-Chief who did not hold flag rank, Lord Dartmouth,
then in command of an expedition against Algiers, hit upon the idea
of granting a similar pendant to the senior captain of three or more
ships that might casually happen to be in company. His orders, dated
1st January, 1684<a name="FNanchor_294" id="FNanchor_294"></a><a href="#Footnote_294" class="fnanchor">[294]</a>, contain the following provisions:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>1. That every younger captain, upon his meeting with an elder Captain
at sea or in port (though the rate of the ship which he is in be superior
to the other) pay all fitting respect and obedience by taking in his Pendant....</p>

<p>3. That (abroad) wheresoever more than 2 ships happen to be or meet<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
together the eldest Captain shall put up and wear a Pendant of distinction
and the other captains shall wear the Ordinary Pendant.</p>

<p>4. That the said Pendant of distinction in this Fleet shall be red with
a large Cross at the head and double the breadth of the ordinary Pendant,
two thirds the length of it, and cut with a long and narrow swallow tayle.</p>
</div>

<p>It was within the competence of Dartmouth to give such an order
to the squadron serving under him, but the practice seems to have
been kept up after he had left the Mediterranean, for Captain Sir
Roger Strickland, writing to Pepys from the Bay of Bulls in September,
1686, complained</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Had I wore a Flag in this Expedition, I might then have had a sight
of Capt. Priestman's orders for his keeping the King's Ships under his
command so long here, at so extra an expence, &amp; I am no less surprised
at his wearing a swallow-tail'd flag at his main topmast head much broader
than his ensign, having a St Andrew's Cross in it as well as St George's,
being indeed such a thing as I never saw, seeming to turn the King's flag
&amp; Pend<sup>t</sup> into ridicule when at ye same time ye D. of Mortmar rides by him
w<sup>h</sup> only a small Pend<sup>t</sup>...<a name="FNanchor_295" id="FNanchor_295"></a><a href="#Footnote_295" class="fnanchor">[295]</a>.</p>
</div>

<p>From a "particular draft" of this pendant given to Pepys it
appears that it was very broad and short, with a red swallow-tailed fly,
and a blue saltire, surmounted by a red cross, on a white ground
at the head. Captain Priestman was brought to book and had to
apologise to the king for his action.</p>

<p>The practice of wearing a senior officers' pendant, although never
officially recognised, appears to have extended and to have been put
down by the following order issued in July, 1692:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Whereas we are informed that some of the Comanders of their Ma<sup>ts</sup>
ships do take the liberty to wear Distinction Pendants without any order
for the same, contrary to the Rules of the Navy: We do hereby strictly
charge &amp; require all Capt<sup>ns</sup> &amp; Comanders of their Ma<sup>ts</sup> Ships &amp; Vessels
&amp; others hired into their service That they do not presume upon any pretence
whatsoever to wear any other Pendants in the Ships they comand,
then the Ordinary Pendants w<sup>h</sup> have by the constant practice of the Navy
been worne in their Ma<sup>ts</sup> Ships of Warre without particular order in writing
from this Board for soe doeing<a name="FNanchor_296" id="FNanchor_296"></a><a href="#Footnote_296" class="fnanchor">[296]</a>.</p>
</div>

<p>After this we hear no more of this pendant until the great change
of 1864, when the following provision was made in the regulations
promulgated on that occasion:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>When two or more of Her Majesty's Ships are present in Ports or
Roadsteads, a small Broad Pendant (White, with the St George's Cross)
is to be hoisted at the mizen-top-gallant-mast-head of the Ship of the
Senior Officer.</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span></p>

<p>A slight modification was introduced in the <cite>King's Regulations</cite> of
1906, which ordered that in ships with less than three masts this
pendant should be hoisted at the "starboard topsail-yard-arm." This
was again modified in 1913 when the senior captain at a port, if the
senior naval officer there present, was instructed to hoist this pendant
at the masthead while any Commodore junior to him on the list of
captains was also present in that port.</p>

 This is perhaps due to the fact that the English Lord Admirals adopted a
ship in full sail upon the obverse of their seals. We have no specimen of the reverse

 Throughout the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries the term "Admiral"
was used of the ship as well as of the officer in command. The rank, moreover,
until the latter part of the seventeenth century, was purely local and temporary,
and simply denoted the senior officer for the time being of the ships in company.</p></div>

circumstance that in nearly all these cases the fleet was directed against Scotland.
One exception to the rule occurs in 1315 when John of Argyle was appointed
"Captain of our fleet of ships which we are shortly about to send to the Scottish
parts." Under him were placed "William de Crey and Thomas de Hewys, Admirals
of the fleet of the King's ships," who were "commanded that they be obedient

<h2><a name="Chapter_V" id="Chapter_V"></a><a href="#CONTENTS">Chapter V</a></h2>

<h3><i>Colours of Distinction</i></h3>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">Boteler</span>, in his <cite>Dialogues</cite>, reminds us that "Flaggs (to speake
properly) are only those which are borne out in the Topps of
Shyps, and they serve as Badges, and that as well for the distinguishing
of Nations as Commanders ... the others are named the Colours
or Ensigns and Pendants." To these was added in 1633, while he
was writing these Dialogues, the jack, or small Union flag flown at
the bowsprit, which, with the ensign and pendant, completed the
"suit of colours" for a ship of war. The differentiation by this means
of the various classes of public and private ships reached its culminating
point by the middle of the nineteenth century. At that
period British ships were divided into five categories, each with its
own special flags of distinction, according to their employment, as:</p>

<p class="pp">1 Public ships of war.</p>
<p class="pp">2 Private men-of-war.</p>
<p class="pp">3 Public ships for uses other than war.</p>
<p class="pp">4 Merchant ships.</p>
<p class="pp">5 Pleasure craft.</p>

<p>Since that date the "colours" of the first of these five classes (and
incidentally those of the third and fourth classes) have been simplified
by the abandonment of the squadronal colours in 1864, while the
second class has disappeared in consequence of the abolition of
privateering by the Declaration of Paris in 1856.</p>

<h4><a name="Chapter_Va" id="Chapter_Va"></a><a href="#CONTENTS">(i) PUBLIC SHIPS OF WAR</a></h4>

<p>The Distinction Colours proper to a British ship of war are the
Pendant, Ensign and Jack. Of these three flags the pendant (or
streamer, as it was originally named) is by far the most ancient,
dating back to the days when there was no rigid distinction between
public and private men-of-war, when every ship owned by an Englishman
was, in the eyes of the law, the king's ship, and might be
requisitioned for his use at a moment's notice and, with the aid of a
few planks and balks of timber, be converted into an efficient ship-of-war,
with fore and after castle and fighting-top complete. Besides
such "castles" a ship, devoted for the time being to warlike purposes,
whether in a national or semi-private quarrel, had as a distinctive<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
mark, from the end of the thirteenth century onwards (and probably
from an even earlier date) a huge streamer displayed from the masthead,
or hung from the fighting-top, and often reaching down to the
water.</p>

<p>These colours, first the pendant, then from 1634 to 1864 the
pendant and jack, and finally all three of them together, have served
to distinguish ships "of war" from ships not fitted out for war, but
the pendant and ensign, with occasional assistance from a masthead
flag, have also served for a secondary distinction within the main
category "of war," namely, that tactical distinction of lesser groups
among a collected body of ships of war which may be termed squadronal
distinction.</p>

<p>Squadronal distinction colours were the outcome of the development
of naval tactics. So long as a battle between two opposing fleets
of any size is to be fought pell mell, like a gigantic football scrimmage,
there is obviously no need for other flags than such as mark out the
two opposing parties, with perhaps the addition of special flags of
command to denote the ships of the two leaders. But directly the
attempt is made to bring intelligence to bear as well as courage and
brute force, to derive advantage from superior skill in manoeuvring,
and to use the ship itself as an actual weapon instead of a mere transport
to carry opposing warriors into touch with each other, it becomes
necessary to co-ordinate the movements of the various ships under
the direction of some master mind. If these ships are few in number
their movements can be readily directed from one centre; but if they
are many, experience shows that the whole fleet must be divided into
distinct parts (called squadrons) of which the principal one will
remain under the direct control of the commander of the whole fleet,
while each of the others is placed under the immediate control of a
subordinate commander, who is directly in touch with the Commander-in-Chief
and acquainted with his intentions and wishes.</p>

<p>It then becomes necessary to furnish the ships comprising the
various squadrons with some means whereby they may be readily
distinguished should they become separated, or should the fleet fall
into temporary disorder.</p>

<p>Among the ancient Egyptians, Greeks, and Romans this appears
occasionally to have been provided for by painting some part of the
ship in a distinctive colour<a name="FNanchor_297" id="FNanchor_297"></a><a href="#Footnote_297" class="fnanchor">[297]</a>, but this method has the disadvantage
that the ships of the various squadrons are not readily interchangeable,
and it appears to have gone out of use before the Christian era.</p>

<p>With the passing of the great days of the Greek states the art of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
sea warfare suffered an eclipse from which it did not recover for many
centuries, and we meet with no further indication of the existence of
fleets organised in squadrons until the thirteenth century of our era.
The proper stimulus for the development of the art of fleet tactics
can only be supplied by the collision of two maritime powers of fairly
equal intelligence and resources. This condition was first supplied
by the rivalry of Genoa, Pisa, and Venice for the sea-borne trade of
the Mediterranean.</p>

<p>The great fleet fitted out by Genoa in 1242 affords one of the
earliest recorded instances (perhaps the earliest) of a tactical division
into squadrons by means of flags. The circumstances have already
been related, and it will be remembered that the squadron leaders
were then distinguished by flags appropriate to the district from
which they had been selected. This method is evidently insufficient,
for although it enables the individual ships of a squadron to recognise
their leader, it does not enable that leader to distinguish his own
ships in the confusion of battle. The next step is to distinguish the
individual ships by suitable flags according to their squadrons. We
do not know when this step was taken, but it appears from the Instructions
issued by Amadeo of Savoy in 1366 to the combined fleet
under his orders<a name="FNanchor_298" id="FNanchor_298"></a><a href="#Footnote_298" class="fnanchor">[298]</a> that each galley then carried the standard of the
Commune whence it came, so that it is possible that the galleys were
at that time organised in squadrons according to their respective
Communes. At the great Battle of Lepanto in 1571, which marked the
culmination of galley tactics, the combined fleet under the command
of Don John of Austria was divided into squadrons with distinguishing
pendants.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The first division or right wing numbered fifty-four galleys, and was
commanded by Giovanni Andrea Doria, whose galley was distinguished
by a broad green pennant at the peak of the mainyard, smaller pennants
of the same colour being displayed in the same position by the other vessels
of the division. The centre, under Don John of Austria, consisted of sixty-four
galleys, with blue pennants flying at the masthead. The left wing of
fifty-three galleys was commanded by Agostino Barbarigo, and was marked
by yellow banderoles on the foreyard, that of the leader flying at the peak
of the mainyard. A rearguard or reserve followed the line of battle, and
was composed of thirty galleys under the Marquis of Santa Cruz. They
displayed white pennants from a flagstaff over the stern lamp<a name="FNanchor_299" id="FNanchor_299"></a><a href="#Footnote_299" class="fnanchor">[299]</a>.</p></div>

<p>But in the stormy seas of northern Europe the galley never became
naturalised, and it was long before the teaching of the school of tactics
that had grown up in connection with it came to be applied to the
larger vessels required for the navigation of these waters. The fleet
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>under Hubert de Burgh, which in 1217 put an end to Lewis the
Dauphin's hopes of adding the Crown of England to that of France,
made use of only elementary tactics, though indeed these proved
amply sufficient, and very little advance had been made three centuries
and a half later, when the Spanish Armada was crushed and
driven away from the shores of England<a name="FNanchor_300" id="FNanchor_300"></a><a href="#Footnote_300" class="fnanchor">[300]</a>.</p>

<p>No attempt appears to have been made to divide an English fleet
into squadrons with distinctive signs until the reign of Henry VIII.
After the rather unsatisfactory battle with the French fleet off Portsmouth
in July, 1545, Henry, who was of no mean ability in naval
affairs<a name="FNanchor_301" id="FNanchor_301"></a><a href="#Footnote_301" class="fnanchor">[301]</a>, had evidently seen the need for better organisation, for when
the fleet put into the Channel to deter the French from raiding the
Sussex coast it was divided into three divisions distinguished by having
the English flag at different mastheads, as is shown by the orders
issued for the occasion:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="no-indent">... every ship appoynted to the battaill shall beare one flag of saint George's
crosse in his mayne toppe ... and every ship appoynted to the vanward shall
beare one flag of sainte George's crosse in his fore toppe ... and every Shipp
Galliasse pynnesse and Shalupe appoynted to the wyng shall have in ther
mesyn toppe one flag of saint George's crosse<a name="FNanchor_302" id="FNanchor_302"></a><a href="#Footnote_302" class="fnanchor">[302]</a>.</p>
</div>

<p>This seems to have been the only occasion on which an English
fleet was divided into squadrons distinguished by means of the same
flag flown at different mastheads. In two years from that date Henry
was dead, and the organisation of the navy sustained a set-back from
which it took many years to recover. It was not until the results of
the first day's fighting against the Spanish Armada in 1588 had shown
the necessity for better organisation that any further attempt was
made to divide the fleet into squadrons. There is no indication in
the State Papers of the steps then taken to mark the squadrons, but
from the fact that the arrangement was impromptu and that there
was no time available for providing special colours it is probable that
only the squadron leaders were distinguished by their flags.</p>

<p>In his expedition against Lisbon in the following year Drake made
an attempt to remedy the prevailing want of method.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The Armada campaign, as we have seen, had taught the sailors the
danger of entirely discarding the old military methods; they had learnt
the strength that the Spaniards gained by their squadronal system, and
under the soldiers' influence we find an elaborate scheme for "squadronising"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>the fleet that is something entirely new, and obviously founded on
the existing military system<a name="FNanchor_303" id="FNanchor_303"></a><a href="#Footnote_303" class="fnanchor">[303]</a>.</p></div>

<p class="no-indent">Here, again, we know nothing of the method adopted to distinguish
the squadrons, but it seems to have been largely a paper one.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Such was the first attempt to remedy the vices of the radical revolution
which the sailor-admirals had brought about. That it smacked too much
of the camp to please the seamen is not to be doubted. Excellent as it
looked on paper, for some reason it took no hold; and for a thorough and
lasting fleet system the English navy had to wait till half a century later,
when the exploits of the new school of soldiers had so entirely weaned the
country from its "idolatry of Neptune" that Cromwell and his soldier-admirals
were able to force their ideas upon the seamen<a name="FNanchor_304" id="FNanchor_304"></a><a href="#Footnote_304" class="fnanchor">[304]</a>.</p></div>

<p class="no-indent">It is evident that the plan took no hold upon the navy, for the
Instructions for a fleet at sea drawn up by Sir John Hawkins some
time between this date and his departure on his and Drake's last
voyage in 1595 contain no provision for any such division by
squadrons<a name="FNanchor_305" id="FNanchor_305"></a><a href="#Footnote_305" class="fnanchor">[305]</a>.</p>

<p>The first instance, after 1545, of the systematic division of the
fleet into squadrons occurs in the Cadiz Expedition of 1596. There
were four English squadrons and one Dutch. The squadronal colours
of the admirals have already been fully described, but, unfortunately,
we have no record of the colours worn by the private ships. There
were in this fleet sixteen ships belonging to the Crown: these were
supplied with 145 flags and ensigns at a cost of £371. 8<i>s.</i> 4<i>d.</i>, but
although the size and price of each flag is given, the colours are never
once mentioned in the accounts<a name="FNanchor_306" id="FNanchor_306"></a><a href="#Footnote_306" class="fnanchor">[306]</a>. From the variations in the prices
of flags of the same size, it is clear that they were of many different
patterns. Possibly each ship wore an ensign of the same colours as
the squadronal flags of the admirals; if so it was the first occasion on
which this method was used.</p>

<p>One thing alone is clear; the distinction was not made by the
pendants, which appear all to have been white<a name="FNanchor_307" id="FNanchor_307"></a><a href="#Footnote_307" class="fnanchor">[307]</a> and hung only from
the mizen yards. Yet it was the pendant which was ultimately adopted
as the squadronal distinction colour. The first definite proposal to
this end occurs in the "Notes on Sea Service"<a name="FNanchor_308" id="FNanchor_308"></a><a href="#Footnote_308" class="fnanchor">[308]</a> submitted by Captain
John Young to the Earl of Essex, probably just before the Cadiz
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>Expedition of 1596. Young, who commanded merchant ships in the
naval operations of 1588, 1589, and 1596, writes:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>That the Lord High Admiral, or any of the Admirals having charge of
their several squadrants or quarters, and companies unto them appointed,
and if they would know which of all their companies or squadrants so
appointed do come into the fight or no. Then it is very convenient and
very necessary to know who doth or doth not come in, and that every
Admiral and all his own company must wear upon their mizen yardarms
pendants, and look how many Admirals you have&mdash;so many several colours
of pendants you must have also, unto the full complement of your ships,
barks, and pinnaces. By which means and being accomplished you shall
easily see and perceive who doth come into the fight or not, which without
these sundry colours of your pendants it cannot be otherwise perceived,
for that divers ships being something afar off may resemble one another
and not be known the one from the other for these sundry coloured
pendants<a name="FNanchor_309" id="FNanchor_309"></a><a href="#Footnote_309" class="fnanchor">[309]</a>.</p></div>

<p class="no-indent">This proposal was not adopted in 1596, but in the Algiers Expedition
of 1620 the fleet was divided into three squadrons, the ships of which
were distinguished by pendants at the main, fore, and mizen tops
respectively.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>... the Admirall Squadron was kept sixe leagues from the shore with
pendants in the maine toppes for their signes: the Vice Admiral's squadron
three leagues without him, on his bowe, with pendants on his foretops,
the Rear Admirall three leagues within him, on his quarter, with pendants
on their mysentops.</p></div>

<p class="no-indent">The colours of these pendants are not stated, but from the pictures
of the homecoming of the Prince of Wales in 1623, now at Hampton
Court and Hinchinbrook, it appears that the pendant was still white,
as in 1596, with the St George's cross at the head. The same arrangement
of pendants was employed for the fleet which transported the
Queen from Boulogne in June, 1625<a name="FNanchor_310" id="FNanchor_310"></a><a href="#Footnote_310" class="fnanchor">[310]</a>.</p>

<p>For the great expedition to Cadiz which set forth in October, 1625,
the pendants, while still displayed at the three different mastheads
according to the squadron, were further distinguished by being made
of different colours. The Admiral's Squadron had red pendants at
the main; the Vice-Admiral's, blue pendants at the fore; and the
Rear-Admiral's, white pendants at the mizen.</p>

<p>The field of the ensign had, since its introduction about 1574,
been of striped design<a name="FNanchor_311" id="FNanchor_311"></a><a href="#Footnote_311" class="fnanchor">[311]</a>. In 1621 a large red ensign was manufactured
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>at a cost of £4. 16<i>s.</i>, and a few more were made in the following years.
The suggestion for a general change to this colour emanated from
Sir F. Stewart, the Rear-Admiral of the fleet, who had been nominated
Admiral of the White Squadron for the Cadiz Expedition. Writing
to Sir John Coke from the 'Lion' on 2nd July, 1625, he says: "A red
ancient would become every one of the King's ships." Owing to the
defective state of his ship, Stewart did not accompany the expedition
when it finally sailed, but his suggestion was evidently adopted, for
the surveys of ships' rigging made in January of the following year
contain several entries of red ensigns, "serviceable" or "decayed,"
but as these are accompanied by other entries for the same ships of
"ancients" which are not particularised, it is clear that the older
ensigns were not all immediately withdrawn from service. Probably,
from motives of economy, they were retained in use until worn out.</p>

<p>The flags flown by the Admirals of the various squadrons of the
fleet that sailed to the Ile de Ré in 1627 have already been described;
no record has, however, been preserved of the method (if any) by
which the private ships of those squadrons (which were composed
largely of merchantmen) were distinguished. The probability is that
they did not wear any special ensigns or pendants.</p>

<p>A survey of the stores at Deptford carried out in April, 1633,
gives the following flags:</p>

<p>As the four striped ensigns are reported "new but unserviceable"
it may be inferred that the old striped form had now been definitely
abandoned. Moreover, a similar survey carried out the month before
at Portsmouth contains entries of four new "White Ensignes" and
two new "Blew Ensignes," so that the white and blue ensigns had
by 1633 made their appearance in the fleet. Unfortunately, the almost
complete disappearance of the naval records of this period prevents
us from ascertaining the precise occasion of the birth of these two
ensigns; but they do not appear to have been yet in general use for
distinguishing the private ships of squadrons, for Boteler, in his Six
Dialogues written at this date, states that pendants were employed
for that purpose.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><em>Admiral.</em> Colours and Ensignes I take to be all one, but wher are they
to be placed and wherefore serve they?</p>

<p><em>Captain.</em> They are placed in the Sternes or Poops of Ships; and very
few Ships there are, whether Men of Warre or Merchantmen, that are
without them. And their especial Service is, that when any strange Shypps
meet one with another at Sea, or fynde one another in any Harbour or
Rode, by the shewinge abroade thes Ensigns or Colours, it is knowne one
to another of what country they are and to what place they belong.</p>

<p><em>Adm.</em> Serve thes Colours or Ensigns for noe other employments but
only this?</p>

<p><em>Capt.</em> Yes to many other, by waye of direction<a name="FNanchor_312" id="FNanchor_312"></a><a href="#Footnote_312" class="fnanchor">[312]</a>, as shall be sett downe
largely in our next dayes discourse.</p>

<p><em>Adm<sup>l</sup>.</em> What are the Pendants you mentioned even now, and wherefore
serve they?</p>

<p><em>Capt.</em> A Pendant is a long Piece of silk or other stuff, cut out pointed
wise towards the end in form of a streamer, wher they are slit into two
partes, and the use of them, to distinguish the Squadrons of great fleetes
by hanging them out in the topps of suche shyps as carry noe flaggs. As,
for example, all suche Shypps as are of the Admiralls Squadron are to
hang them out in their maine topps, thoes of the Vice Admiralls Squadron
in their Fore-tops and thoes of the Reare Admiralls in their Missen-tops.
And here alsoe they are to be of severall Colours. But besides this use, in
great ships and especially suche as belong to the King, they are often
used by way of trimme and braverye, and are then hung out att every
Yarde-arme and att the heades of the Masts. And thes only are their uses
and employments.</p>
</div>

<p>It was not until the crucial period of the First Dutch War that
the practice of supplying all the ships of a squadron with ensigns
of the squadronal colour became established. The proposal to divide
the fleet into three squadrons, one under each of the three "Generals
at Sea," with red, blue and white ensigns and pendants respectively,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>was first made in January, 1653. This was apparently one of the
results of the attempt then being made to improve the fleet tactics in
view of the unsatisfactory results of the earlier actions of the war<a name="FNanchor_313" id="FNanchor_313"></a><a href="#Footnote_313" class="fnanchor">[313]</a>.
It was, however, not until early in March that definite steps were
taken for this purpose. The Navy Commissioners then gave orders
for the urgent manufacture of a number of pendants and ensigns,
forty of each colour, all having the "red crosse in chief," the order
of precedence of the colours being at the same time changed from
red, blue, white, to red, white, blue. This new order of precedence
remained unchanged until squadronal colours were abandoned in
1864.</p>

<p>The circumstances in which the St George's cross was introduced
into the fly of the white ensign in May, 1702, have already been detailed.
The old form with plain fly was, however, not immediately
superseded; both forms were in use as late as 1717, but by 1744 the
older form had entirely disappeared. It is difficult to understand why
the two forms should have been allowed to continue after the short time
requisite for wearing out any ensigns of the earlier pattern that might
be in existence when the change was ordered in 1702, but the surveys
of stocks and orders for stores establish the fact that it was so, and
that the form with the cross through the fly, known as the "St George's
ensign," was at first issued only to ships which were appointed to
serve outside home waters.</p>

<p>On the legislative union of England and Scotland in 1707 the
tiny Scots navy came to an end as a separate force, and the "Union"
colours, invented on the union of the two crowns a hundred years
before, were inserted in all ensigns, naval and mercantile. An Order
in Council of 21st July, 1707, established as naval flags the royal
standard, the Union flag and "the ensign directed by her Majesty
since the said Union of the two Kingdoms," which from the coloured
draughts attached to the order is seen to be the red ensign. The white
and blue ensigns are not mentioned in this Order; evidently the red
ensign was alone regarded as the legal ensign of Great Britain and
the others as merely variations of it for tactical purposes. In conveying
this Order to the Navy Board, the Lord High Admiral instructed
that body</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="no-indent">to cause the several ships and vessels of the Royal Navy to be with all
possible dispatch furnished with Colours accordingly, and for the speedier
and cheaper doing the same ... to order St George's Cross to be taken out
of all the ensigns and a Union Jack Flagg put into them in the roome
thereof, or to alter the said Colours in such other manner as you shall
judge best for the Service.</p>
</div>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
It was found that the jacks in store were not of the same shape as the
old canton, so finally all the ensigns were returned to the contractor
"to be made Union."</p>

<p class="p2" />
<p>Except for the slight change caused by the insertion of the Irish
Saltire in accordance with the Royal Proclamation of 1st January,
1801, on the legislative union of the Irish Parliament with that of
Great Britain, no further change in the design of the three ensigns
has taken place, though the shape has been gradually altered from a
proportion of roughly 5 by 4 to that of 2 to 1. By Order in Council
of 9th July, 1864, the squadronal use of the ensigns in the navy was
abandoned, and the principal ensign, the red, was made the exclusive
property of the Mercantile Marine, which had shared it in common
with the navy since the time of Charles I. The second ensign, the
white, was retained for H.M. ships, and the third&mdash;the blue&mdash;assigned
to the Naval Reserve, then recently formed, and to ships belonging
to the Civil Departments of the navy and other departments of State.</p>

<p>The reason for this change is set forth in the Memorial of the
Admiralty Board to the Council in the following words:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The Flag Officers of the Fleet, whether Admirals, Vice-Admirals or
Rear-Admirals, are classed in Squadrons of the Red, White and Blue, and
are (with the exception of the Admiral of the Fleet) authorised to fly their
Flags of the colour of the Squadron to which they belong, this regulation
necessitating the adoption of ensigns and pendants of a corresponding
colour in every ship and vessel employed under their orders, each vessel
is therefore supplied with three sets of colours, and the frequent alterations
that have to be made when the Fleet is distributed as at present, under
the orders of many Flag Officers, is attended with much inconvenience
from the uncertainty and expense which the system entails.</p>

<p>The increased number and size of merchant steamships render it a
matter of importance to distinguish on all occasions men-of-war and private
ships by a distinctive flag; the latter vessels bearing at present the same
Red Ensign as Your Majesty's Ships when employed under an Admiral
of the Red Squadron. It also appears to us to be desirable to grant (under
such conditions as we may from time to time impose) the use of a distinguishing
flag to such ships of the Merchant Service as may be employed
in the public service, whose Commanding Officer (with a given portion of
the crew) may belong to the Royal Naval Reserve. We therefore most
humbly submit that Your Majesty may be pleased by Your Order in Council
to prescribe the discontinuance of the division of Flag Officers into Red,
White and Blue Squadrons, and to order and direct that the White Ensign
with its broad and narrow pendant be henceforward established and recognised
as the colours of the Royal Naval Service, reserving the use of the
Red and Blue colours for such special occasions as may appear to us or to
officers in command of Fleets and Squadrons to require their adoption.</p>
</div>

<p>It will be seen that the reasons for the change given in this
memorial are, first, the inconvenience and expense of keeping up the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>three sets of colours, and then (apparently as an afterthought) the
need of a distinctive flag for the mercantile steamship. But in fact
the man-of-war was already clearly distinguishable from the merchantman
by its pendant and jack, a distinction that had been found
sufficient for a period of two hundred years; a period during which
the merchantman was, for the most part, much more like the man-of-war
in outward appearance than it was in 1864. The real reason undoubtedly
was that the squadronal organisation of the days when
squadronal colours were first invented had become obsolete, and
changes in tactics had rendered the squadronal colours unnecessary.</p>

<p>Before the change was made the opinions of a number of the
leading admirals were taken. The majority agreed that the squadronal
colours were no longer necessary and that their abandonment would
be for the good of the Service. There were one or two, however,
who thought otherwise, and it was pointed out that it had been found
convenient during the Russian war of 1854-5 to divide the fleets in
the Baltic and Black Sea by means of these colours. When Vice-Admiral
Sir Charles Napier took command of the Baltic fleet he
found that he and his two Rear-Admirals were all "of the Blue,"
and he therefore told one of them to hoist the red colours and the
other the white, retaining the blue for himself, so that for this occasion
the blue was the principal colour. Similarly, both Rear-Admirals in
the Black Sea being "of the Red," one temporarily hoisted the white
colours.</p>

<p>The fact that the division of fleets into red, white and blue
squadrons was no longer a tactical necessity had been to some extent
recognised before the end of the eighteenth century, for Howe concluded
his fighting instructions, issued in 1782, with the following
article:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>In action, all the ships in the fleet are to wear red ensigns.</p>
</div>

<p>Probably this was inspired largely from fear of the inconvenience
that might arise from the white ensign being mistaken for the French
national flag, but the fact that Howe issued such an instruction would
seem to indicate that he did not regard the squadronal colours as
indispensable. Nevertheless, in the battle of the "Glorious First of
June" in 1794 his fleet was divided by squadronal colours, and the
'Marlborough' suffered through having her white ensign mistaken
for the French national flag, then white with a tricolour canton<a name="FNanchor_314" id="FNanchor_314"></a><a href="#Footnote_314" class="fnanchor">[314]</a>.</p>

<p>Shortly after this the French fleet began to fly the new tricolour
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>flag (as at present used) which had been adopted in February, 1794,
but was not supplied to the fleet until October. Thereafter there was
no danger of confusing it with the white ensign, and as that was now
the ensign most unlike the French flag, it was usually ordered to be
flown in action by the Admiral in command. Thus on the 10th
October, 1805, Nelson issued the following memorandum:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>When in presence of an Enemy, all the Ships under my command are
to bear White Colours, and a Union Jack is to be suspended from the fore-topgallant
stay<a name="FNanchor_315" id="FNanchor_315"></a><a href="#Footnote_315" class="fnanchor">[315]</a>.</p>
</div>

<p class="no-indent">And when the enemy opened fire at Trafalgar, Collingwood (who was
a Vice-Admiral of the Blue) hoisted his blue flag, but all the fleet,
including his own flagship, hoisted white ensigns. Nelson's device of
displaying an extra Union flag to ensure that no mistake should arise
as to nationality is of interest, for the same course was at first adopted
in the recent war, the British and German ensigns being very much
alike at a distance. Early in the war the red ensign was substituted
for this Union flag, and the practice of hoisting additional red ensigns
on H.M. ships was followed to the end.</p>

<p>By the Colonial Naval Defence Act of 1865 it became lawful for
any colony, subject to certain conditions, to provide and maintain its
own vessels of war, and these were authorised to wear the blue
ensign with the seal or badge of the colony in the fly and a blue
pendant. In 1913, as an outcome of the Imperial Conference of 1911,
the ships of the Naval Forces of the Dominion of Canada and the
Commonwealth of Australia were further authorised to</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="no-indent">wear at the stern the White Ensign as the symbol of the authority of the
Crown, a White Pendant at the masthead, and at the jack-staff the distinctive
flag of the Dominion, viz: the Blue Ensign with the badge or emblem
of the Dominion in the fly.</p>
</div>

<p>The ships of the Royal Indian Marine occupy a somewhat ambiguous
position. Some of them&mdash;the floating defences&mdash;may be
regarded as a Colonial Navy, others might more properly be included
in class (3), Public Vessels. The old Indian marine took its rise in
1613, when the East India Company found it necessary to fit out for
use only in Indian waters small vessels, which although employed to
a certain extent in local carrying trade were sufficiently well armed
to be of use in keeping in check the numerous native pirates who
sought to prey upon the East Indiaman in those waters, and also to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>afford protection to the Company's vessels and factories against the
ill-will of their European rivals, particularly the Portuguese. After
the transfer of Bombay to the Company in 1668 that town developed
into the principal seat of the Company's power, and the Indian
Marine became known as the Bombay Marine. This gradually rose
to such importance locally that from 1759 to 1829 a Captain of this
service was annually appointed, as a deputy of the Company, to
the post of Admiral of the Mogul Emperor, flying the flag of the
Mogul at the main-mast-head and the Company's colours at the
stern of his flagship.</p>

<p>From the earliest years the Company's ships were in the habit of
flying pendants, and the proclamations of 1694 and subsequent years
that forbade the use of these flags by other than H.M. ships were not
obeyed&mdash;perhaps their existence was not known&mdash;in Indian waters.
From the beginning of the eighteenth century it became customary
to describe the senior officer of the Bombay Marine as "Commodore,"
and for him to fly a broad pendant. This practice had never received
the sanction of the home authorities, though Admiral Watson, who
was in command of H.M. ships in the East Indies station from 1754
to 1757, appears to have approved of the use of a common pendant<a name="FNanchor_316" id="FNanchor_316"></a><a href="#Footnote_316" class="fnanchor">[316]</a>
by the Company's armed ships.</p>

<p>In 1764, while carrying out arrangements connected with the
evacuation of Manilla, Captain Brereton arrived at Batavia in H.M.S.
'Falmouth' and found there Commodore Watson, of the Bombay
Marine, in the Company's ship 'Revenge' flying a red broad pendant.
On the approach of the 'Falmouth' this was hauled down and a
common pendant substituted. Brereton ordered this to be struck,
and Watson thereupon hoisted the Company's colours and a broad
distinguishing pendant. Brereton then sent an officer on board to
demand that this also should be struck, and after a stormy scene it
was done, but the pendant was again hoisted a short time afterwards.
A second officer was sent to the 'Revenge,' but Watson positively
refused to strike it. The next morning the 'Revenge' was seen clearing
for action, with a number of armed men in her maintop to repel any
attempt to touch the pendant. A third officer was then sent to the
'Revenge,' and when the junior officers of that ship realised what the
result of proceeding to extremities was likely to be they gave up the
pendant to him.</p>

<p>This example illustrates well the anomalous position in which the
Indian navy stood; on the one hand it was recognised as a Colonial
naval force, on the other it was treated as though it were merely a
part of the British merchant service.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>The position does not appear to have been regularised until 1827,
when the Admiralty issued a warrant that granted the ships of the
Bombay Marine</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="no-indent">the privilege of wearing in addition to the Red Ensign, which all ships
belonging to His Majesty's subjects should legally wear, the Union Jack
and a long pennant having St George's Cross on a white field in the upper
part next the mast with a red fly.</p>
</div>

<p class="no-indent">The curious expression "should legally wear" seems to have reference
to the fact that the legality of the old striped ensign of the Company
had recently been called in question, and its use, except as a
jack, had in consequence been abandoned. It will be observed that
the Warrant makes no mention of a broad pendant, but the Bombay
Marine (or Indian navy as it was called after 1830) evidently still
made use of it, for in 1848 the officer acting as commander-in-chief
of H.M. ships on the East Indies Station objected to the flying of the
red broad pendant, and as a result it was decided that the Commander-in-Chief
of the Indian navy should fly a broad pendant, red
with a yellow cross, and the Company's cognisance of the yellow lion
rampant, holding a crown, in the upper quarter next the staff, the
Commodore of the Indian navy serving in the Persian Gulf being
allowed a similar flag with a blue field<a name="FNanchor_317" id="FNanchor_317"></a><a href="#Footnote_317" class="fnanchor">[317]</a>.</p>

<p>In 1858, when the Government of India was transferred to the
Crown, the military and naval forces were transferred with it, but
the Indian navy did not find favour in the eyes of its new masters,
and it was abolished. This took place in 1863, when the following
ceremony was observed:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>At noon on the 30th inst. the broad pennant of Commodore Frushard
will be saluted by eleven guns from the battery at the Apollo Pier. The
flag of the Indian Navy, long known as "the Company's Jack," will then
be hoisted at the Castle flagstaff and saluted by twenty-one guns. At the
close of the salute the Indian Jack will be hauled down, the broad pennant
of Commodore Frushard and the pennants of all the Indian Naval vessels
in harbour will be struck, and the Indian Navy will cease to exist as an
effective service<a name="FNanchor_318" id="FNanchor_318"></a><a href="#Footnote_318" class="fnanchor">[318]</a>.</p>
</div>

<p>A new "Bombay Marine," consisting of a few small vessels engaged
in the local transport and pilotage service of that port, similar
to one that had already come into existence at Calcutta, was thereupon
instituted. The Indian Marine Service Act of 1884 made provision
for placing the vessels belonging to the Government of India
under the Naval Discipline Act in time of war, and for constituting
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>such ships vessels of war in the Royal navy. At the same time a
warrant was issued authorising the vessels of the Indian Marine (to
which the Prefix "Royal" was added in 1892) to fly a blue ensign with
a badge of the Star of India in the fly, and a Union jack with a blue
border. These vessels were in November, 1921, authorised to fly
a red pendant when in commission.</p>

</div><div>

<h4><a name="Chapter_Vb" id="Chapter_Vb"></a><a href="#CONTENTS">(ii) PRIVATE MEN-OF-WAR</a></h4>

<p>The "private man-of-war" or "privateer<a name="FNanchor_319" id="FNanchor_319"></a><a href="#Footnote_319" class="fnanchor">[319]</a>" was a vessel the
owner (or owners) of which had received from the Crown, or from
the Lord High Admiral, "Letters of Marque and Reprisal." The
occasion for the issue of such a licence, which was originally granted
in the form of Letters Patent&mdash;whence the name&mdash;might be either
special or general. It might be issued "specially" to some merchant
who was able to prove that he had suffered certain losses from the
action of the subjects of some foreign power, and who was thereupon
authorised to make seizure of any ships or goods belonging to subjects
of that State until he had by that means taken sufficient plunder
to make good the losses formerly sustained by him, but no more.
Such licences were also issued "generally" upon the outbreak of
hostilities with a foreign state, to any subjects who wished to make
war upon enemy vessels on the chance of making some profit by it,
and who were able to give satisfactory security that they would comply
with the regulations laid down for their conduct, particularly in the
matter of the disposal of prizes taken. During the wars of the late
seventeenth and eighteenth centuries merchants frequently sought
Letters of Marque for their vessels, not because they wished them
to take the offensive as regular privateers, but because they were
thereby freed of all danger of being classed as "pirates" should they
attempt to turn the tables upon any enemy that attacked them. For
this reason many, perhaps most, of the ships of the East India and
Guinea Companies fitted out in the seventeenth century carried
Letters of Marque and displayed the Union jack.</p>

<p>Indeed, despite the issue of the Proclamations of 1634 and 1674,
it seems that all privateers in the seventeenth century were in the
habit of wearing the Union jack&mdash;sometimes with the permission of
the authorities, but more often without it&mdash;with the object of making
themselves look (so far as flags were concerned) as much like the
king's ships as possible. The instructions for privateers issued toward
the end of that century indicate that there was some infirmity
of purpose on the part of the authorities in enforcing the existing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>law as regards the wearing of the Union jack. Thus the Instructions
for privateers operating against Algiers<a name="FNanchor_320" id="FNanchor_320"></a><a href="#Footnote_320" class="fnanchor">[320]</a>, issued in December, 1681,
provided</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>That the merchants, captains, and others who shall have such letters
of marque or commissions as aforesaid shall not weare in their said ships
our Union flagg or jack (which is intended to distinguish our owne ships
of warr from all others) at no time nor upon no pretence whatsoever,
unless they be warranted for so doing by an order of leave under our hands
and seal of our lord high Admirall or Commissioners of the Admiralty,</p>
</div>

<p class="no-indent">whereas the Instructions for Privateers fitted out against France
issued in May, 1693, merely ordered that the Union jack or pendant
(which actually were illegal without special warrant) should not be
worn in presence of H.M. ships or in circumstances in which they
might give occasion to a salute by a friendly foreign power.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>That such merchants, commanders of ships, and others, who shall
obtain such letters of marque or commissions as aforesaid shall not wear
our colours, commonly called the Union Jack or pendant on board such
ship or vessell by them fitted out in pursuance of such our commission, in
company of any our men of warr, or so near any other men of warr belonging
to any nation in amity with us, so as to occasion any salute from them,
or in or near any port or road whatsoever.</p>
</div>

<p>A special distinguishing flag for privateers was first provided in
the Royal Proclamation issued in July, 1694, which ordained that
vessels receiving "Commissions of Letters of Mart or Reprisals"
should wear, in addition to the St George's flag at the masthead
and the red ensign with canton of St George at the stern, "a Red
Jack with the Union Jack described in a Canton of the upper corner
thereof next the staff"&mdash;the flag that Pepys in 1687 called the Budgee
jack&mdash;which was in fact of the same design as the red ensign adopted
in 1707, though apparently the canton occupied a larger proportion
of the area of the flag in the jack than in the ensign<a name="FNanchor_321" id="FNanchor_321"></a><a href="#Footnote_321" class="fnanchor">[321]</a>.</p>

<p>Despite this precise direction, the privateer Instructions issued
against France and Spain in December, 1704, contain the same
instructions as those of 1693 quoted above, which presuppose that
these vessels would fly the Union jack and pendant, which the Proclamation
of 1694 had forbidden&mdash;but indeed, this muddle-headed
attitude is not uncommon in official instructions. It is clear that
privateers did carry pendants, for Woodes Rogers relates that he was
ordered to strike his pendant by the 'Arundel' in August, 1708,
"which we immediately did, all private commissioned ships being
obliged by their Instructions to pay that respect to all her Majesty's
ships and fortifications." The Distinction Jack of 1694 (subject to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>the necessary modification of the Union in 1801) remained the distinguishing
flag of a privateer until privateering was abolished in
1856.</p>

</div><div>

<h4><a name="Chapter_Vc" id="Chapter_Vc"></a><a href="#CONTENTS">(iii) PUBLIC SHIPS FOR USES OTHER THAN WAR</a></h4>

<p>The first suggestion that public ships which were not men-of-war
should wear some distinctive flag is found in the <cite>Sub Notes about
Flags and Colours</cite> drawn up by Pepys about the year 1687. He writes:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>And here above all it is to be reflected on what distinction is to be
made (as to the wearing of the Union Flag) between the King's own Ships,
great or small, and hired ones, either as men-of-war (many of which both
at Home and in the Plantations have been made up of hired Merchant
Men) or for lower uses, as little as Victuallers, Water Ships, Store Ships,
Pressing boats, Transporters etc. Wherein is to be considered whether if
it be wholly necessary even in some of these occasions, as well as those of
the Custom House, Green Cloth &amp;c. some kind of distinction-flag might
not be found sufficient to answer all the ends suggested for wearing the
Jack Flag, without prostituting that to such low uses and ready insults<a name="FNanchor_322" id="FNanchor_322"></a><a href="#Footnote_322" class="fnanchor">[322]</a>,
which so much deference is expected to by us from the ships of foreign
Princes and States of the greatest force and rate.</p>
</div>

<p>The Revolution of 1688 put an end to Pepys' reforming activities,
and no steps were taken to distinguish such ships until 1694, when
a Royal Proclamation issued 12th July provided that</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Such Ships and Vessels as shall be employed for Their Majesties'
Service by the Principal Officers and Commissioners of Their Majesties'
Navy, the Principal Officers of T.M. Ordnance, the Commissioners for
Victualling T.M. Navy, the Commissioners for T.M. Customs, and the
Commissioners for Transportation for T.M. Services, relating particularly
to those Offices shall wear a Red Jack with the Union Jack in a Canton at
the upper corner thereof next the staff, as aforesaid, and in the other part
of the said Jack shall be described the Seal used in the respective Offices
aforesaid by which the said ships and vessels shall be employed.</p>
</div>

<p>An Order in Council of 19th November in the same year provided
further that "boats imployed in the service of the Generall
Post Office be permitted to carry colours to distinguish them from
other boats, and that in the said Colours there be represented a man
on horseback blowing a Post horne," and from later papers in the
same year it appears that the intention was that this device should be
placed in the fly of the red jack, like the seals of the other government
departments.</p>

<p>The proclamations of 1702 and 1707 confirmed the use of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>red jack with the seal of office, but the King's Regulations of 1731
introduced a slight variation by providing that the seal might be
placed in the body of the jack <em>or</em> ensign; the Regulations of 1806
completed the transfer by directing that the seal should be described
"in the fly of the ensign," and the Regulations of 1844, not content
with this, provided that the seal or badges should be placed "in the
centre of both Ensign and Jack."</p>

<p>In July, 1864, the colour of the Ensign was altered to blue, and
the red jack became an Union jack with a white border, both with
the seals or badges as before, but the introduction of the "white
bordered Jack" into this clause of the Order in Council appears to
have been a slip, for the Addenda to the Regulations published in
1868 specified that the jack was to be of the same design as before
but blue, like the ensign, and thus it remains; the difference between
the jack and the ensign being that the former is smaller and square<a name="FNanchor_323" id="FNanchor_323"></a><a href="#Footnote_323" class="fnanchor">[323]</a>,
instead of oblong in the proportion of two to one.</p>

<p>The badges of the offices referred to in the proclamation of 1694
were as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><em>Navy Office.</em> An anchor without cable in pale, with two smaller anchors
on each side of the shank.</p>

<p><em>Ordnance Office.</em> This badge was similar to that now used by the War
Office (<a href="#PLATE_XI">Plate XI</a>, 7), but the colour of the shield appears to have been
originally red with a yellow chief.</p>

<p><em>Victualling Office.</em> Two anchors with cables in saltire.</p>

<p><em>Customs.</em> A castle gate. A regal crown was substituted for this in 1817.
From that date until the Coastguard Service was transferred to the
Admiralty in 1856 all vessels engaged in prevention of smuggling under
the Customs, Excise and Admiralty flew red ensigns and pendants with
this crown upon them.</p>

<p><em>Transport Office.</em> A plain anchor.</p>
</div>

<p>In 1701 the Admiralty complained to the King that the Governors
of the plantations&mdash;the English Colonies of North America and the
West Indies&mdash;were in the habit of authorising certain merchant
ships, to which they gave commissions, to wear the colours of the
king's ships. This the Governors claimed to do in virtue of their
Vice-Admiralty commissions and because they conceived</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="no-indent">it necessary for the security of ships sent out by them for H.M. Service,
as well as for the honour of H.M. Commissions that these ships be
authorised to bear such colours as may distinguish them from ordinary
merchants' ships and other common trading vessels.</p>
</div>

<p class="no-indent">Presumably these ships, which certainly engaged in "common
trade," were also employed on protection and police duties that would
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>normally have been performed by ships of the Royal navy, had such
ships been present there in sufficient numbers. On the 31st July of
the same year an Order in Council was issued directing such ships
to wear a jack with a white escutcheon<a name="FNanchor_324" id="FNanchor_324"></a><a href="#Footnote_324" class="fnanchor">[324]</a> in the centre, and forbidding
them to wear the ordinary Union jack. I have not met with this
special form of jack at any later date, and it seems probable that the
use of these colonial hired ships was discontinued after Benbow
arrived in these waters in the late autumn of that year, though an
Article providing for the use of the jack appeared some years after
in the Instructions issued to the Governors of these colonies. It might
seem that these vessels should be classed as hired men-of-war or as
privateers, but the memorial of the Admiralty to the Council places
them in the category of "those employed by the Officers of the Navy,
Ordnance, Victualling and others."</p>

<p>After the disappearance of this jack there were no special distinguishing
flags for colonial vessels until 1866, when it was laid
down that ships in the public service of a colony might fly the blue
ensign with the distinguishing badge of the colony.</p>

<p>Besides the Public Offices there are a number of corporate bodies
whose functions are of a public nature and who have the right to fly
a special flag upon their vessels at sea. The most ancient of these is
the Corporation of Trinity House, a body first incorporated by
Henry VIII in 1514. Its flag (<a href="#PLATE_XII">Plate XII</a>, fig. 4) may be seen flying
upon the Trinity yacht when leading the Admiralty and Royal yachts
during a review of the fleet, or when escorting the sovereign at sea;
on such occasions the Trinity yacht flies also a white ensign. The
duties of this Corporation are, however, mainly concerned with the
erection and maintenance of lighthouses, beacons and other sea marks
around the English coast. Similar duties in Scottish waters are performed
by the Commissioners of Northern Lighthouses, who fly
upon their vessels a blue ensign with a white lighthouse in the fly,
the Commissioners' own flag being a form of white ensign without
the St Patrick's cross in the Union, and with a blue lighthouse but
no St George's cross in the fly. Vessels belonging to Lloyds fly a
blue ensign with the badge shown in <a href="#PLATE_XII">Plate XII</a>, fig. 10. The Port of
London Authority, Thames Conservancy, Humber Conservancy, and
Mersey Docks and Harbour Board have each their special badge, but
these are of no historical interest. The modern Cinque Ports flag
(<a href="#PLATE_XII">Plate XII</a>, fig. 5) is now never flown at sea, but is flown upon
Walmer Castle, the residence of the Lord Warden.</p>

<h4><a name="Chapter_Vd" id="Chapter_Vd"></a><a href="#CONTENTS">(iv) MERCHANT SHIPS</a></h4>

<p>As already remarked, the first legislative enactment providing for
a distinction between the flags of merchantmen and ships belonging
to the Crown was in the year 1634. We shall briefly review the position
of affairs in the earlier years of that century. When James I united the
crowns of England and Scotland in 1603 the English merchant ships
were in the habit of flying the St George's flag at one or more mastheads,
while those of Scotland flew the St Andrew's flag in a similar
manner. It seems that in the great majority of these ships no other
flags were flown, but some of the larger ships, especially those engaged
in voyages to foreign parts, seem to have allowed themselves
the additional luxury of a striped ensign (which appears to have been
displayed only when attacking or resisting attack from pirates or
other foreign ships, or when signalling to consorts), and also a number
of pendants or streamers, which were probably only used on like
occasion, or on occasions of special ceremony or rejoicing. Thus, for
the ships fitted out by the East India Company in January, 1601,
there was provided "for eche of the shippes 12 Streemers, 2 fflagges
and one Auncient." In an inventory of the Company's ship 'Hector'
of the preceding September there is mentioned besides "2 ancyents
and 28 pendaunts," "a smale flag for the boat spirrit." This is the
earliest instance in which I have met with a jack flag for the bowsprit
in an inventory, and its use at this date must have been extremely
rare and exceptional.</p>

<p>On the union of the two crowns, disputes as to precedence of
flags appear to have broken out between the English and Scots merchant
seamen, hitherto "foreigners" to each other. James attempted
to remove the cause of these by providing in 1606 a combined flag,
which was to be borne by both parties in their maintop, the English
retaining the St George's cross at the foretop and the Scots the
St Andrew's cross. So far as the Scots were concerned this attempt
at compromise appears to have been rejected, for reasons already
related in Chapter III, but the English adopted it. Thus, in the period
between 1606 and 1634 the English merchantmen were bearing aloft
two flags: the "Britain" flag, as it was then called, and the St George's
flag, and although they were warned in the Proclamation of 1606 not
"to bear their flags in any other sort" it is clear that some were also
using on the poop a striped ensign with a St George's cross in a
canton. The colours of the stripes appear to have been a matter of
individual taste. Thus the ensign illustrated in the contemporary
map<a name="FNanchor_325" id="FNanchor_325"></a><a href="#Footnote_325" class="fnanchor">[325]</a> of Baffin's voyage for the discovery of the North-west Passage
in 1615 displays red, green and blue stripes<a name="FNanchor_326" id="FNanchor_326"></a><a href="#Footnote_326" class="fnanchor">[326]</a>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>In 1634 the inconveniences arising from the fact that the king's
ships and merchant ships wore the same flags had become so pronounced
that a Proclamation was issued withdrawing the right to
use the Union flag for the merchant ships and confining those of
England to the St George's flag and those of Scotland to the St Andrew.
No mention is made of any poop ensign, from which it may be
inferred that this flag was not yet in common use among merchantmen.
By the time of the Commonwealth the striped ensign appears
to have gone out of use, and the merchantmen seem to have gradually
adopted the red ensign introduced into the fleet in 1625. The order
of 1649 requiring the ships in the service of the State to bear the
St George's flag only does not seem to have been applied to merchant
ships, and from a reference in 1656 to the flying of the "English
Collers" improperly by a merchant ship lying at the Brill, when
these colours were worn "with the Cross downewards" (i.e. the flag
being inverted in contempt) it is clear that the English ensign at that
date had the cross in a canton, and was not the plain St George's
flag. The use of the red ensign was for the first time legally recognised
as the distinctive flag of a British merchant ship in a Proclamation
of 1674<a name="FNanchor_327" id="FNanchor_327"></a><a href="#Footnote_327" class="fnanchor">[327]</a>, in which the colours are expressly laid down as being</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="no-indent">those usually heretofore worn on merchants' ships, viz: the Flag and Jack
white with a red cross (commonly called Saint George's Cross) passing
right through the same; and the Ensign red with a like cross in a canton
white at the upper corner thereof next the staff.</p>
</div>

<p class="no-indent">This order definitely abolished the use of any striped ensign, if any
such still survived outside of the East India Company's ships. The
red and white striped ensign<a name="FNanchor_328" id="FNanchor_328"></a><a href="#Footnote_328" class="fnanchor">[328]</a> of that Company, which was probably
adopted on its formation in 1600, remained, however, unchanged in
spite of the Proclamation, and in 1676 the Commander-in-Chief in
the Downs drew Pepys' attention to the fact. In his reply of the
20th November Pepys wrote:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>For that of the different colours assumed by the East India Company
and ordinarily worn in their ships, I am very glad you take notice of it,
though it be not of any so near resemblance to the King's as to create any
mistake, which some have heretofore offered at, yet it being contrary to
the letter of the proclamation it will be fit that his Majesty's pleasure be
known in it<a name="FNanchor_329" id="FNanchor_329"></a><a href="#Footnote_329" class="fnanchor">[329]</a>.</p>
</div>

<p class="no-indent">Pepys mentioned the matter to Sir John Bankes, one of the principal
members of the Company, urging him to get the use of this flag
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>regularised, and in the December of this same year he wrote to
Bankes as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>I have fresh occasion of repeating what I lately mentioned to you about
colours worn by the ships belonging to the East India Company different
from what the merchant ships of other his Majesty's subjects generally do,
and by his Majesty's proclamation of 18th Sept. 1674 ... are bound to use,
without any provisional exception made therein on behalf of the said Company;
for want thereof, not only his Majesty's commander-in-chief in the
Downs but others of his captains and officers are under an obligation of
interrupting your ships in the wearing the said colours, and have several
of them applied themselves to me at sundry times (and now lately) for
direction therein, with answer still given them by me in favour of the Company
as knowing their and their predecessors' usage in that matter, and the
moment it may be of to them that the same should be continued; but, forasmuch
as it cannot be thought fit for me to remain under a constant accountableness
for any behaviour of his Majesty's officers different from
his pleasure signified by a proclamation, I desire you will please to take an
opportunity of mentioning this thing to my honoured friends of your
Company, to the end that (in case their service be indeed concerned in
the continuance of this their usage) they may take some way of making
their desires therein known to his Majesty, that so what he shall think fit
to indulge to them upon it may be done by an order pursuant to the said
proclamation, and his officers thereby indemnified in their obedience of it<a name="FNanchor_330" id="FNanchor_330"></a><a href="#Footnote_330" class="fnanchor">[330]</a>.</p>
</div>

<p>Apparently the matter was adjusted to the satisfaction of Pepys,
for the striped flag<a name="FNanchor_331" id="FNanchor_331"></a><a href="#Footnote_331" class="fnanchor">[331]</a> continued to be used by the Company until the
year 1824, when, on the question of its legal position being again
raised, its use as an ensign was discontinued, though it remained in
existence until 1863 on the Company's ships as a jack or signal flag<a name="FNanchor_332" id="FNanchor_332"></a><a href="#Footnote_332" class="fnanchor">[332]</a>.</p>

<p>The flags laid down for the merchant ships by the Proclamation
of 1674 were confirmed by further Proclamations in July, 1694, and
December, 1702, with the additional restriction that such ships were
expressly forbidden to wear "any kind of pendant whatsoever." As
these proclamations were addressed to all "loving subjects" they
were presumably binding on the Scots as well as on the English, but
the use of the St Andrew canton certainly persisted in the ships of
the Scots navy, and therefore presumably in the merchant ships of
Scotland.</p>

<p>On the legislative union between England and Scotland in 1707
a further Proclamation was issued, which contained a fundamental
difference. In the Proclamation of 1674, 1694, and 1702 the merchant
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>ships had been forbidden to use any other colours than "those usually
worn," but they were not expressly ordered to wear any colours at
all. In the Proclamation of 1707, under which the Union replaced
the St George in the canton of the red ensign, a clause was inserted</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="no-indent">strictly charging and commanding the Masters of all Merchant Ships
and vessels belonging to any of our subjects, whether employed in Our
service or otherwise, and all other persons whom it may concern, to wear
the said ensign on board their ships or vessels.</p>
</div>

<p class="no-indent">They were further forbidden to wear "any Flags, Jacks, Pendants or
Colours made in imitation of ours, or any kind of Pendant whatsoever,
or any other ensign than the ensign described." This did not
prohibit the use of the St George's jack on the bowsprit, which was
expressly recognised by the <cite>King's Regulations</cite> for the navy<a name="FNanchor_333" id="FNanchor_333"></a><a href="#Footnote_333" class="fnanchor">[333]</a> as
being, together with the red ensign, the appropriate colours for a
British merchant ship.</p>

<p>In consequence of the legislative union with Ireland, a proclamation
was issued on 1st January, 1801, substituting the new
form of the Union in the canton of the ensign, but leaving the existing
regulations unaltered. The provision for the use of the St George's
jack by merchant ships last appeared in the 1808 edition of the
<cite>Regulations and Instructions relating to His Majesty's Service at Sea</cite>
in the following terms:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Merchant Ships are to carry a Red Ensign with the Union Jack in a
canton, at the upper corner next the staff, and a White Jack with a Red
Cross, commonly called St. George's Cross, passing quite through it.</p>
</div>

<p class="no-indent">How far such regulations, which in the preamble are expressly stated
to be drawn up for the "Naval Service at Sea," can have been legally
binding on the Mercantile Marine is a matter for lawyers to decide,
but it seems probable that the merchant service did not generally
observe the regulation as to the jack, for in the next edition (that of
1824) all reference to it is omitted. From that date the red ensign
alone has been the legal national colours of a British merchant vessel.
It must be displayed</p>

<p>(<em>a</em>) On a signal being made from one of H.M. ships or from a
vessel under the command of an officer of the Royal Navy on full pay.</p>

<p>(<em>b</em>) On entering or leaving any foreign port.</p>

<p>(<em>c</em>) If the vessel is of 50 tons gross tonnage or more, on entering
or leaving any British port.</p>

<p>Merchant ships commanded by officers on the retired list of the
Royal Navy or by officers of the Royal Naval Reserve may, on certain
conditions laid down in the <cite>King's Regulations</cite>, be allowed to wear
a blue ensign instead of a red one.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
No British merchantman may, under penalty of £500 and confiscation
of the colours, wear any other "distinctive national colours,"
nor any other flags or pendants in any way resembling those of
H.M. ships, but there is nothing in the Merchant Shipping Act to
prevent any such ship from wearing any fancy flags that it likes&mdash;even
if some covert disloyalty is intended thereby&mdash;provided that such
flags are not "distinctively" national and do not imitate the flags of
the navy, and that it displays the red ensign upon the proper occasions.</p>

<p>The law on the subject of the flags to be flown by British merchantmen
was, as will have been seen, sufficiently explicit, and the
flags allowed by no means inferior in dignity or traditional sentiment
to those withheld; nevertheless, the merchant skipper, until a comparatively
recent period which may be dated roughly as the beginning
of the reign of Queen Victoria, seems to have taken an especial
delight in attempting to evade the law. Attempts to fly the Union
jack have already been sufficiently illustrated. Another idiosyncracy
was the flying of the blue instead of the red ensign. St Lo dealt with
this at Jamaica in 1728 by an ingenious device, that of using the
Crown's right of impressment to deprive such ships of one of the most
important members of the crew: "rather than be troubling their
Lordships with complaints of taking them away, I have found out
another expedient, which is to get a Carpenter or Caulker from them,
so that I hope in a little time to bring them to better reason."</p>

<p>In 1819 the master of a ship in home waters who had persisted
in flying a blue ensign and pendant although repeatedly fired at, was
prosecuted by the Admiralty, but upon his appeal the prosecution
was dropped with the hope that "it will be understood that any
future violation of the law will be punished strictly." Two other
ships were, in the following year, prosecuted for flying pendants, and
in 1821 the attention of the Commanders-in-Chief was called to the
existing regulations "relative to Colours to be worn by private ships
which it has been apprehended have not been generally attended to."</p>

<p>Not long after this date the custom of flying at a masthead a
"house" flag denoting the ownership of the vessel became general,
and perhaps for this reason or because they were living in a more
prosaic age the captains of merchantmen ceased to give further
trouble by attempts to display illegal colours. There are now many
hundreds of house flags<a name="FNanchor_334" id="FNanchor_334"></a><a href="#Footnote_334" class="fnanchor">[334]</a> in existence, but nearly all of them have
come into use since 1840. An older practice with some of the larger
merchantmen, which seems to date from the early years of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>eighteenth century, was to fly the arms of the town in which the
master lived at the mizen, and the arms of the town where the freighter
resided at the fore. Some passenger ships plying on regular lines
(such as the cross-Channel steamers) fly at the fore the national flag
of the country to and from which they sail.</p>

<p>The somewhat anomalous position of the ships of the East India
Company, many of which were given Letters of Marque in order to
regularise their position as combatants if they came into conflict with
ships of native states (or possibly with those of other European
powers) in Indian waters, has already been remarked. No trace can
be found of any formal grant of the Company's flag, and it seems
most probable that it was really the survivor of an early striped ensign
such as many ships, men-of-war or merchant, wore in the latter part
of the reign of Elizabeth and the early part of the reign of James.
There was, however, an early precedent of the grant of a special flag
to specified merchantmen to denote a privileged position. In 1581
Elizabeth, anxious to encourage the trade then being opened up with
Turkey, granted a Charter of Incorporation for a term of seven years
to Sir Edward Osborn and three other merchants, who might add
other Englishmen, not exceeding twelve in all, to their number.
These were allowed "to set and place in the tops of their ships and
other vessels the Arms of England with the red crosse over the same,
as heretofore they have used the red crosse, any matter or thing to
the contrary notwithstanding." On its expiry in 1588 this charter
was not renewed, but in 1593 Osborn and others were incorporated
in a company to be known as the Governor and Company of Merchants
of the Levant, and they were "to set and place in the toppes
of their ships or other vessels the Armes of England with the redde
crosse in white over the same as heretofore they have used." It would
appear from these words that the red cross in the original flag was
bordered with white, although it is not so described in the earlier
charter. The Charter of 1593 was found defective, and a new one
was issued in 1601 which contained the same clause, the name of the
company being changed to the "Governor and Company of Merchants
of London trading into the Levant Seas." On the death of
Elizabeth this charter lapsed, and it was not until the 14th December,
1605, that another charter was issued. This charter, which remained
in force until 1825, omits all reference to the flag. Possibly James
already had in mind the Union flag that was established early in the
next year, and indeed the design of the Union flag is distinctly
reminiscent of the old Levant Company's flag&mdash;the banner of Scotland
taking the place of the Arms of England. The omission from this
charter of any provision for a special flag cannot have been other
than intentional, nevertheless the ships of the company seem to have
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>continued to use the old flag in Levant waters, for in 1625 Sir Thomas
Roe, then Ambassador to Turkey, issued a general proclamation "To
all Captaynes, Maisters, pursers and officers of any English shipps
and all other his Ma<sup>tie</sup> Subjects serving or sailing in them within y<sup>e</sup>
Levant Seas," ordering "that from hence forth they, nor none of
them presume to use or beare any other flagg or coulers than y<sup>e</sup>
usuall flagge and Red Crosse of England, or St Andrewe of Scotland,
neither in the Levant Seas nor in any Port of the Grand Signior's
Dominion, upon what pretence soever." From this time the "usual
flag and Red Cross of England" became very prominent in those
waters and gradually replaced the French flag as protector of the
lives and goods of foreign merchants trading within the Sultan's
dominions. The various capitulations by which this was effected were
consolidated in 1675 by a Treaty of Commerce made between
Mahomet IV and Charles II<a name="FNanchor_335" id="FNanchor_335"></a><a href="#Footnote_335" class="fnanchor">[335]</a>, which, among other things, provided
"that the Merchants of Spain, Portugal, Ancona, Seville, Florence,
Catalonia, and all sorts of Dutch and other foreign Merchants ...
might always come under the Flag and Protection of the Ambassadors
or Consuls of England."</p>

<p class="p2" />
<p>There were other trading companies that, like the East India
Company, had or assumed the right to fly a special flag, in this case
probably only as a jack. One was the Guinea, or Africa, Company,
the ships of which from the time of Charles II onwards flew a
St George's flag with a chequered border of two rows of red and white
squares. This practice probably originated with the third company,
chartered in 1662, and of course expired on the dissolution of the
fourth company in 1752. Another was the so-called Scottish East
India Company which started its short life in 1695 and is best known
from its disastrous attempt to colonise the Isthmus of Darien. Its
emblem of the rising sun (<a href="#PLATE_X">Plate X</a>, fig. 4) indicated the dawn of hopes
that were doomed to an early eclipse.</p>

<p>Special forms of the red ensign may be flown by merchant ships
of three of the <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;original text: British Dominons">British Dominions</ins>, viz. Canada, Australia and New
Zealand. This privilege was first granted to Canada in the year 1892,
the badge of Canada without the Crown (see <a href="#PLATE_XII">Plate XII</a>, fig. 7) being
placed in the centre of the fly.</p>

<p>In 1899 merchant ships registered in New Zealand were authorised
to wear a red ensign having in the fly four white stars, representing
the constellation of the Southern Cross. In this connection it may be
remarked that in 1834 the British resident in New Zealand proposed
that the New Zealanders should have a national flag. Three patterns
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>were sent over by the Governor of New South Wales, and by a narrow
majority the chiefs voted for the one represented in <a href="#PLATE_XII">Plate XII</a>, fig. 1.
New Zealand was then an independent country; in 1839 it was added
to the British dominions and after the grant of its Constitution in
1852 this flag appears to have been dropped, to be subsequently
revived by the Shaw Savill and Albion Shipping Company, which
now uses it as a "house flag."</p>

<p>A red ensign for Australian merchant vessels was first approved
in 1903. It had a six-pointed white star (indicating the six states) in
the centre of the lower canton and five smaller stars, representing
the Southern Cross, in the fly. In 1908 the large star under the Union
had the number of its points increased to seven (see the similar blue
ensign in <a href="#PLATE_XII">Plate XII</a>, fig. 3).</p>

<p>No other dominion or colony is at present allowed the privilege
of "defacing" the red ensign, but any colonial merchant vessel is at
liberty to carry, in addition to the red ensign, a flag containing the
badge of the colony, provided that such a flag is not "distinctive
national colours" (i.e. does not contain or imitate the Union).</p>

<p>A merchant ship commanded by a retired officer of the Royal
Navy or by an officer of the Royal Naval Reserve may fly the blue
ensign under Admiralty Warrant if the crew includes ten officers or
men belonging to the Reserve. The formation of a reserve among
officers of the merchant service was first authorised by Act of Parliament
in 1861, and in the following year it was decided that a merchant
ship commanded by such an officer might fly a blue ensign
with a crown and the letters R.N.R. in the fly; the abolition of the
squadronal colours of the navy in 1864, however, enabled the blue
ensign undefaced by a device to be assigned to the Reserves, and the
device was thereafter omitted.</p>

<h4><a name="Chapter_Ve" id="Chapter_Ve"></a><a href="#CONTENTS">(v) PLEASURE CRAFT</a></h4>

<p>For the introduction into Great Britain of craft built solely for
pleasure and large enough to navigate the open sea or the estuaries
of large rivers we need look no further back than the restoration of
Charles II. From the earlier years of the seventeenth century the
wealthy inhabitants of the Netherlands had included among their
recreations the sailing of specially designed boats upon their numerous
waterways. With the presentation to Charles in 1660 of two of the
Dutch yachts we may, for all practical purposes, date the inauguration
of this form of recreation in England. The fashion set by the King
and his brother gradually spread among the wealthier classes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>Except those belonging to the King, all such pleasure craft would
legally form part of the mercantile marine, and in the absence of
special permission to the contrary could only wear the flags appropriated
to that service. Yet from an early date the owners attempted
to appropriate to themselves some special distinction. The failure of
the Governor of Dover in 1676 to obtain the King's permission to
fly the Union jack on his private yacht has already been noticed.
This failure did not deter others from assuming such a right. In
1686 the question of the liberty taken by private yachts to wear the
King's jack without license came before the Navy Board, and Pepys,
who was present, has left us the note upon the motives leading to
such evasions of the law, which has been already considered in
Chapter III (<a href="#Page_69">page 69</a>).</p>

<p>The yachts belonging to James II (who reserved the Office of
Lord High Admiral to himself throughout his reign) flew, in addition
to the royal standard at the masthead and Union jack, a special red
ensign, with St George's cross in the canton, and in the fly an anchor
and cable surmounted by the royal crown.</p>

<p>The first attempt to democratise yachting and to form a club to
facilitate its enjoyment came, oddly enough, from the Irish, a nation
that has never, in spite of its natural advantages, shown any marked
liking for the sea. Yet by the formation of the Cork Water Club in
1720 Ireland took a lead that was not followed in England for nearly
a hundred years. The Club adopted as their distinctive flag the Union
jack with the harp on a green escutcheon in the centre, as in the jack
of the Protectorate; this escutcheon was also placed on the Union in
the canton of their ensign. Dissolved in 1765, this Club was resuscitated
in 1806, and was the progenitor of the existing Royal Cork
Yacht Club.</p>

<p>The first corporate body of yachtsmen to be formed in England
was the Royal Yacht Club (now the Royal Yacht Squadron) founded
at Cowes in 1815, when the close of the long war with France rendered
the Channel safe for such a form of amusement. As a distinctive
flag, this Club chose a white ensign with the Union in the canton
but without the St George's cross in the fly. For six years the
Admiralty took no notice of the breach of the law involved in flying
such a flag, but in 1821 the number of yachts had so increased that
the Commander-in-Chief at Portsmouth drew attention to the fact
that a large number of small craft were flying an unauthorised flag.
He received instructions to enforce the law, and the Club had to
content itself with the legal red ensign. In 1829, however, the Admiralty
granted the yachts of the club permission to wear "a
St George's or white ensign," and the club thereupon adopted the
modern white ensign which its members still fly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>This was followed in 1831 by the grant of a blue ensign to the
Royal Northern Yacht Club; a white ensign with "the Arms of Ireland"
in the lower canton next the staff to the Royal Irish Yacht
Club; and a formal grant of the red ensign with "the Union (with
the harp and crown on a green field in the centre) in the corner" to
the Royal Cork Yacht Club.</p>

<p>In 1832 a newly formed Irish club, the "Western Yacht Club,"
which had assumed a green ensign, approached the Admiralty with
a view to the confirmation of this flag on the ground that "a white
ensign has been granted to the 'Royal Yacht Club,' a red ensign to
the 'Royal Cork,' a blue ensign to the 'Royal Northern,' and as the
only unoccupied national flag we have assumed the green ensign<a name="FNanchor_336" id="FNanchor_336"></a><a href="#Footnote_336" class="fnanchor">[336]</a>."
They were informed "You may have as the flag for this Club either
a red, white or blue ensign, with such device within as you may point
out, but that their Lordships cannot sanction the introduction of a
new colour to be worn by British ships." They then chose a white
St George's ensign with "a crown in the centre surrounded with a
wreath of shamrock."</p>

<p>There followed other grants of the white ensign, plain or with
the St George's cross in the fly and with or without special badges.</p>

<p>In 1842 the Royal Yacht Squadron, moved by frequent complaints
of the improper conduct in foreign waters of British yachts, erroneously
supposed, from the fact of their having a white ensign, to belong
to that club, asked that they might have "the sole permission to carry
the white ensign," at the same time suggesting that the other clubs
should have a blue one. The Admiralty acceded to this request and
issued the following circular letter:</p>

<p class="p2" />
<div class="blockquot">
<p class="right">22 July 1842. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; </p>

<p>Sir</p>

<p> &nbsp; &nbsp; My Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty having, by their order
of the 6th June 1829, granted permission to the Royal Yacht Squadron,
as having been the first recognised club, and enjoying sundry privileges, to
wear the White St George's ensign and other distinctions, that their
vessels might be generally known, and particularly in Foreign ports, and
much inconvenience having arisen in consequence of other Yacht Clubs
having been allowed by this Board to wear somewhat similar colours, my
Lords have cancelled the warrant enabling the <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;original text: a blank space">___________</ins> to wear the
white ensign, and have directed me to send you herewith a warrant,
authorizing the vessels belonging to the club to wear the blue ensign of
Her Majesty's fleet, with the distinguishing marks of the club, as heretofore
worn on the white ensign; and as it is an ensign not allowed to be
worn by merchant vessels, my Lords trust that it will be equally acceptable
to the members of the club.</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span></p>
<p>This letter was sent to the Royal Western, the Royal Thames,
the Royal Southampton, the Royal Eastern and the Gibraltar Yacht
Clubs and to the Wharncliffe Sailing Club, but from a misapprehension
the Royal Western Yacht Club of Ireland, once incorporated
with its English namesake, was overlooked. In 1853 this point was
raised in Parliament, but no action was then taken. In 1858, however,
the exemption of the Irish Club was again made a grievance by other
clubs desiring the same privilege, and the warrant of the Irish Club
was then cancelled. The outcry raised led to the papers connected
with the grants of the white ensign being laid before the House of
Commons in 1859<a name="FNanchor_337" id="FNanchor_337"></a><a href="#Footnote_337" class="fnanchor">[337]</a>.</p>

<p>From that date the privilege of flying the white ensign has remained
the prerogative of the Royal Yacht Squadron, a privilege
enhanced in 1864 by its becoming the distinctive ensign of the Royal
Navy.</p>

<p>At the present day forty-four clubs have the privilege of flying
the blue ensign, either plain or "defaced" with some distinctive
badge, and eight are allowed to "deface" the red ensign with their
special badge. Other clubs may fly only the ordinary red ensign of the
Mercantile Marine.</p>

<h3><i>Flag Signals</i></h3>

<h4><a name="Chapter_VIa" id="Chapter_VIa"></a><a href="#CONTENTS">(i) EARLY SIGNALS</a></h4>

<p class="drop-cap2"><span class="smcap">The</span> few scattered references to signals found in early Greek
literature are so vague in their terms that they leave us in doubt
whether the ancient Greeks or their predecessors on the waters of the
Eastern Mediterranean made any use of flags for signalling purposes.
It seems probable that the earliest signals were given by raising the
naval standard which, as we have seen, found a place at the stern
of the Phoenician ships of war at least as early as 400 <span class="smcap">b.c.</span>, and that
the Greeks adopted this method from the Phoenicians, substituting
a cruciform standard for the Phoenician Crescent and Globe.</p>

<p>When Thucydides tells us that the "semeion" was raised in the
Greek fleet we may, in default of some better explanation, assume
that the officer in command seized the cruciform standard and elevated
it at arms' length. Such a signal might be rendered more conspicuous
by throwing a military cloak of bright colour over the arms
of the cross before raising it and, as already remarked, it seems highly
probable that the sign known as Phoinikis (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc" title="phoinikis">φοινικὶς</span>) originated in
this manner.</p>

<p>The earliest recorded instance of a signal at sea is probably that
mentioned by Herodotus<a name="FNanchor_338" id="FNanchor_338"></a><a href="#Footnote_338" class="fnanchor">[338]</a> as having been made by Xerxes in the year
480 <span class="smcap">b.c.</span>, when on quitting Therma in his expedition to Greece he
embarked in a Sidonian ship and "gave the signal (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc" title="sêmêion">σημήιον</span>) to the
rest of the fleet to get under way." A more characteristic&mdash;or more
frequently mentioned&mdash;use of the "semeion" was as a signal to commence
action. The fleet fitted out by the Corinthians against the
Corcyreans in the year 433 <span class="smcap">b.c.</span> met with a joint fleet of Corcyrean
and Athenian ships. Both the opposing fleets drew up in rank and
the "semeia" were then raised on both sides (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc" title="ta sêmeia hekaterois êrthê">τὰ σημεῖα ἑκατέροις ἤρθη</span>) as a signal for beginning
action<a name="FNanchor_339" id="FNanchor_339"></a><a href="#Footnote_339" class="fnanchor">[339]</a>.</p>

<p>Thucydides mentions two other instances<a name="FNanchor_340" id="FNanchor_340"></a><a href="#Footnote_340" class="fnanchor">[340]</a> in which a fleet awaited
the signal before commencing to fight, but the only strictly tactical
signal which he has recorded was one made to the Peloponnesian
fleet in 429 <span class="smcap">b.c.</span> The Peloponnesians had enticed the Athenian fleet
into a disadvantageous position by a feigned attack upon Naupactus.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>At a given signal (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc" title="apo sêmeion">ἀπὸ σημείον</span>) the Peloponnesians suddenly turned
their ships round and attacked the Athenians<a name="FNanchor_341" id="FNanchor_341"></a><a href="#Footnote_341" class="fnanchor">[341]</a>.</p>

<p>Towards the end of the Peloponnesian War (if we may suppose
that Polyaenus, writing in the second century <span class="smcap">a.d.</span>, was not guilty
of anachronism) the purple cloak signal (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc" title="phoinikis">φοινικὶς</span>) comes into evidence.
Conon, the Athenian commander, was in the year 406 <span class="smcap">b.c.</span>
off Mitylene, flying before Callicratidas the Spartan, who had twice
as many ships. Observing that the Lacedaemonian ships had, in the
ardour of pursuit, broken their ranks, Conon raised the "Phoinikis,"
which was the signal he had pre-arranged with the commanders of his
ships, and, turning together, the Athenian ships bore down on their
pursuers, then in disorder<a name="FNanchor_342" id="FNanchor_342"></a><a href="#Footnote_342" class="fnanchor">[342]</a>.</p>

<p>The Rhodians, in the second century <span class="smcap">b.c.</span>, made signals in the
early manner by raising the "signum" or military ensign. Livy relates
that Eudamus, when hard pressed in his action against the
Syrian fleet under Hannibal (191 <span class="smcap">b.c.</span>) made use of such a signal to
call his unengaged ships to the rescue<a name="FNanchor_343" id="FNanchor_343"></a><a href="#Footnote_343" class="fnanchor">[343]</a>.</p>

<p>The earliest code of naval signals is that drawn up in the ninth
century <span class="smcap">a.d.</span> by the Emperor Leo VI in his treatise on Tactics<a name="FNanchor_344" id="FNanchor_344"></a><a href="#Footnote_344" class="fnanchor">[344]</a>. Leo
in the Introduction to his nineteenth chapter explains that he has
been unable to find anything on this subject among ancient Greek
writers except a few scattered references and that his knowledge is
mainly derived from the experience of his Generals.</p>

<p>In this nineteenth chapter, which deals with Naval Warfare (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc" title="Peri naumachias">Περὶ ναυμαχίας</span>) he says:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>39. Let there be some standard (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc" title="sêmeion">σημεῖον</span>) in your ship, either a banner
(<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc" title="bandon">βάνδον</span>) or a streamer (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc" title="phlamoulon">φλάμουλον</span>) or something else in some conspicuous
position, to the end that you may be able, thereby, to make known what
requires to be done, and that the rest may set themselves to carry out the
course of action decided on, whether it be to fight or to withdraw from
fighting; to open out to surround the enemy, or to concentrate to the relief
of an endangered portion of the fleet; to slow the rowing or increase speed;
to make an ambush, or, emerging from ambush to attack the enemy; or,
in general, whatever the signal that has its origin in your ship, that the
others, by keeping an eye on her, may be able to execute it.</p>

<p>40. For in such an emergency you will not be able to make use either
of the voice or of the trumpet to communicate what is necessary, because
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>of the uproar and the tumult, and the sound of the sea, and the crash of
ship against ship, the noise of the oars, and above all the clamour of the
combatants.</p>

<p>41. Further, let the signal be given by setting the standard upright or
by inclining it to the right or to the left, or by moving it twice to the right
or left, or by shaking it, or lifting it up, or lowering it or altogether withdrawing
it or altering its position, or by varying the appearance of the
head by means of devices or colours as was the practice amongst the
ancients; for in time of war they gave the signal for battle by raising what
was called the Phoinikis (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc" title="phoinikida">φοινικίδα</span>). There was also what was called the
"cap" (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc" title="mamelaukion">μαμελαύκιον</span>) raised upon a pole, red in colour, and they had some
other signals which were made known in like manner. Perhaps however
it would be safer to make your signals by your own hand.</p>

<p>42. And thus, O General, let the exercise of these signals be practised,
so that all the officers in command of ships under you may have certain
knowledge of all such signs; of the reason why each is made, and when,
and how, and may not fail. So that, well familiarised with the signals, they
may readily understand them in time of emergency and carry out the orders
indicated.</p>
</div>

<p>In reading the above paragraphs one cannot fail to be impressed
by the profound grasp of the essential requirements of the subject
exhibited by the writer. Nothing like it appears again until modern
times, and the concluding words might well have been written by
Kempenfelt and the other reformers of the Signal System in the
British navy at the end of the eighteenth century.</p>

<p>After Leo we meet with nothing further on this subject until the
middle of the fourteenth century, and from what we then find it is
clear that the art had not only made no progress in the interval, but
on the contrary had decidedly deteriorated. Two sets of instructions
preserved in the <cite>Black Book of the Admiralty</cite>, to which Sir Travers
Twiss assigns a date between 1337 and 1351<a name="FNanchor_345" id="FNanchor_345"></a><a href="#Footnote_345" class="fnanchor">[345]</a>, contain each one flag
signal; one for calling a council, the other for notifying the presence
of the enemy:</p>

<div class = "group">
<div class = "onetext" lang="fro" xml:lang="fro">
<p><em>A xviii.</em> Item est assavoir que a

</div>

<div class = "onetext">
<p>xviii. Also it is to be noted that
at whatever convenient time it
pleases the admiral to call together
the captains and masters of the fleet
to take counsel with them he will
carry high in the middle of the mast
of his ship a banner of council so
that in all parts of the fleet, whether
in ports or out at sea, this may be
recognised and perceived etc., and
then immediately the captains and
masters of ships are bound to assemble
without delay with their
boats well manned with seamen to
row and go on board the ship of the
admiral there to hear and do what
the council of the admiral shall have
ordained.</p>

<p>Item in case any ship or other
vessel of the fleet perceive any
enemy vessel upon the sea then he
shall put a banner aloft by which
the ship of the admiral and other
ships of the fleet may have knowledge
that he has seen one or more
enemy vessels and thus afterwards
give the best orders they know of to
encounter it.</p>
</div></div>

<p>The very primitive tactics in use at this period in northern waters
called for none but the most primitive signals. When at sea, the fleet
gathered each evening round the admiral to take his orders for the
next day, and if by any chance he wished to consult the captains or
had orders to communicate before that hour he took the banner,
which was normally planted on the aftercastle, and placed it halfway
up the mast. When the enemy was seen, the sighting ship displayed
a banner in the top, and thereupon all the ships met together to discuss
what to do. Nothing could be simpler; nothing, one would suppose,
more inefficient in time of emergency; certainly nothing could
be farther from the well-practised organisation inculcated by the
Emperor Leo.</p>

<p>In the waters of the Mediterranean the tradition of a more scientific
method of warfare than simple <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">mêlée</i> fighting had its natural influence
on the method of signalling. The orders issued by Amadeo VI
of Savoy in 1366 for the combined fleet of galleys provided by Genoa,
Venice and Marseilles and sailing under his command<a name="FNanchor_346" id="FNanchor_346"></a><a href="#Footnote_346" class="fnanchor">[346]</a> show a considerable
advance upon those recorded in the <cite>Black Book</cite>. This may
be judged from the following excerpts which include all the articles
relating to flag signals.</p>

<div class = "group">

<p>These are the ordinances for the

concerning the regulation of going
upon the sea.</p>

<p>10. Item when the said Lord

towards that part where it sees the

named, and hold the banner in that
position until the galley of my Lord
has returned the signal and has
raised its banner.</p>

<p>27. Item in case it shall happen
that any of the said galleys has any
occasion of necessity that it has need
of aid, then it shall make a signal
with a banner amidships of the galley

shall approach that place, towards
such galley to aid it, under
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>the penalty named.</p>

<p>28. Item none of the galleys shall

shall face one another<a name="FNanchor_347" id="FNanchor_347"></a><a href="#Footnote_347" class="fnanchor">[347]</a>.</p>

<p>29. Item if it has happened that
one of the galleys has lost the others
and then returns to them to make a
recognition signal by day, that one
which shall be to leeward, either
that one or the one which is at anchor,
shall raise the standard of its
Commune amidships of the galley
and the other galley shall return the
signal and raise the standard of its
Commune in the prow. Each one
shall (then) carry its standard to its
place on the poop<a name="FNanchor_348" id="FNanchor_348"></a><a href="#Footnote_348" class="fnanchor">[348]</a>. Then they will
know which are friends, and this
under the penalty aforesaid.</p>
</div></div>

<p>It will be seen that both these sets of instructions give prominence
to a signal for calling a Council and both, curiously enough, betray
the same confusion of thought. From the opening sentence it would
be supposed that the captains of the ships are assembled to advise
the Admiral in Council; from the closing sentence it would appear
that they are only called to hear the result of the council's deliberations.
The "etc." in the English Instructions and the repetition at the
end of Article 10 in the Savoy Instructions seem, however, to indicate
that the texts have not reached us in their original state. In the English
fleet the "Banner of Council" signal remained in use until the close
of the eighteenth century<a name="FNanchor_349" id="FNanchor_349"></a><a href="#Footnote_349" class="fnanchor">[349]</a>. As a rule this signal was made with the
royal standard, though in 1369 a special gonfanon was provided and
in the reign of Henry V the "Trinity Royal" had a banner of council
containing the royal arms and the cross of St George<a name="FNanchor_350" id="FNanchor_350"></a><a href="#Footnote_350" class="fnanchor">[350]</a>. When the
fleet was large, as in the Cadiz Expedition of 1596, the royal standard
was hoisted for the "selected" or inner council while the flag of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>St George called the captain and the master of every ship to the
flagship for a general council.</p>

<p>But while in the English fleet the Banner of Council signal underwent
no development until the end of the sixteenth century, the
Mediterranean instructions of 1366 contain three signals of this
nature: one to call the council, another to call all the ships when
some order had to be communicated, and a third to call one or
more particular vessels. These, with the addition of one signal for
calling aid, one manoeuvring signal, and a recognition signal, to
which were added signals by sails and, at night, by lanterns, contain
the germ of a complete system of signalling.</p>

<p>It is not until the middle of the seventeenth century that we meet
with so advanced a system in the English navy. If an explanation of
this be sought it will be found in the fact that the rowing galley was
not suited to the waters of the English Channel and North Sea. If
the Mediterranean nations had, in the Middle Ages, a comparatively
advanced system of tactics and therefore&mdash;for the one inevitably
follows the other&mdash;a comparatively complete method of signalling,
it was because they had inherited the foundations of it with the galley
from the Romans and Greeks. The sailing-ship did not assert its
superiority over the older weapon until the early part of the sixteenth
century, and it was another century before the seamen who manned
it could be persuaded that the methods of tactics invented for the
despised galley could be of use when applied to vessels whose motive
power was of another order. It was the soldier-admirals, who were
well acquainted with the value of formal tactics on shore, who taught
the English navy the lesson it was so loath to learn.</p>

<p>The Instructions of 1366 just quoted may be taken as representative
of the fourteenth century. For the fifteenth century we have at
least two good examples; the orders for the Venetian navy drawn up
by Mocenigo<a name="FNanchor_351" id="FNanchor_351"></a><a href="#Footnote_351" class="fnanchor">[351]</a> in the year 1420 and the orders for the navy of Castile
drawn up by Fadrique Henriquez<a name="FNanchor_352" id="FNanchor_352"></a><a href="#Footnote_352" class="fnanchor">[352]</a> in 1430. It will be sufficient to
extract from the Venetian orders, which are the more interesting
for our immediate purpose, the various articles relating to flag signals.</p>

<p>First, if he shall see a light galley
or armed galley, he ought to raise
the Ensign of Saint Mark and then
lower it as many times as there may
be ships which he has discovered,
and if there are more he should go
to the Captain and acquaint him
how many galleys he shall have discovered.
If that be a boat or ship he
shall raise his flag on the left side,
if a bark, a pennant on the right
side, making signals with this flag
in the direction in which these ships
are discovered, and if the Captain
wishes the Guard-galley to go to
any of these ships which shall be
discovered, he will raise a square
flag on the right side of the poop
towards that ship, in conformity
with the regulations given below.
And if it shall come to pass that the
guard-galley on going to any ship
under the above order and the Captain
should wish her to turn back
and not to advance further, if the
Captain shall proceed under oars, he
shall order sail to be taken in at
once and shall strike sail, then
having seen this signal the guard-galley
ought to turn at once to him.</p>

<p>Likewise the Captain commands
in case more ships are discovered
and he is determined to go to them;
in this case he shall order his own
standard to be raised, the gold
standard with his arms, at the lanthorn
on the poop, and immediately
all the galleys ought to repair close
to him, and proceed each to her own
post, and order the arms on deck
and order their pavisades to the
prow according to custom, the rest
of the shields to go round the deck,
and on the supports of the awning
the galley slaves' clothes are to be
put as is customary, and at the first
trumpet each man is to arm himself;
at the second to raise the ensign
of Saint Mark and to take refreshments
for their bodies. At the
third, when the square standard
with the ensign of Our Lord Jesus
Christ shall be raised amidships
each ship shall proceed boldly and
in good order, so that one galley
may not hinder another, to board or
come up with the said ships or galleys
and not to leave the battle until
they are finally routed.</p>

<p>And as it often happens that the
galleys are separated one from the
other and are dispersed from the
Captain, therefore he must necessarily
give an order or signal of
recognition by which they may be
recognised by our ships one from
the other by day as well as by night,
as is mentioned below.</p>

<p>If any Galley shall stray from the
Captain, in order to recognise it, if
by day, the Captain makes smoke
on the prow and seeing that signal
the galley which had separated shall
answer by the same signal, and then
the Captain shall order a flag to be
raised on the forward end of the
poop on the right side; and with the
same signal he is to answer and the
Captain shall order to raise a square
flag on the left side of the prow, and
likewise that galley is to answer and
make the aforesaid signal. The Captain
will raise the Ensign of St Mark
and this the galley ought to answer,
and be very attentive not to go
alongside if it does not well recognise
the above signals.</p>

<p>Item the Captain, cruising in any
place, ... not wishing any commander
to lower his boat into the water, will
launch his own boat and raise his
flag on the windward side of the
poop forward, and in this case no
one shall lower his boat as long as
the said flag is hoisted, and if any
does so it shall be under the penalty
which he thinks fit.</p>

<p>Item if the Captain wishes all the
commanders to come to him, he will
put his flag to windward, on the
poop near the ladder, inclined towards
the prow, and then they must
go to him because otherwise he
would have to send for them.</p>
</div></div>

<p>The Venetian orders contain no provision for calling a Council,
but they include two flag signals for calling up the galleys to take
orders. Possibly the Venetians, anticipating Drake, did not assent to
the scriptural dictum that in the multitude of councillors is wisdom.
In the Castilian Instructions there is not only provision for calling
a council by day, by hoisting the royal pendant, but also for calling
an informal council at night. In daytime the captain and a boatswain<a name="FNanchor_353" id="FNanchor_353"></a><a href="#Footnote_353" class="fnanchor">[353]</a>
from each galley had to come in a boat on board the Admiral,
but at night each galley ranged up with the Admiral in turn, spoke
with him, and then fell off again. Another signal not found in the
Venetian Instructions is that for calling assistance; in the Castilian
Instructions this is to be done by raising the royal pendant. There<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
are two signals for discovery of a fleet in those instructions; if the
fleet was recognised as an enemy the sighting galley hoisted the royal
pendant and rushed off to tell the Admiral all about it, without
attempting to denote by signal the number of ships, but if it was
merely a strange fleet the sighting galley contented itself with hoisting
a flag to the masthead and raising and lowering it as many times as
there were ships. The first galley to sight land raised a flag to the
masthead, kept it there a short time, and then lowered it. The recognition
signal differs from that provided in the Venetian orders, but
it contains the same serious defect found in most of the early recognition
signals&mdash;the two ships simply copy one another. In the Savoy
Instructions of 1366 it will be seen that there is a slight variation in
the signals made by the two galleys, sufficient to betray any stranger
not acquainted with the difference. One would have thought that
the necessity for some such device would have been apparent to any
seaman, for the use of an enemy's colours was a well-known artifice
and nothing could be simpler than to copy exactly the signals of
another ship.</p>

<p>For the early sixteenth century we have two important sets of
signal instructions. One of these, the "<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Ordonnances et signes pour
nauiguer jour et nuyt en une armée royale</span><a name="FNanchor_354" id="FNanchor_354"></a><a href="#Footnote_354" class="fnanchor">[354]</a>," drawn up by Antoine
de Conflans about the year 1515 for use in a fleet composed of sailing
ships and galleys, is worth translation in full:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Ordinances and Signals for navigating by day and by night in a navy
royal, if his most Christian Majesty, whom God preserve, or other prince
of the realm, should set out to the conquest of the Holy Sepulchre or other
lands of the enemies of the Holy Catholic Faith, and the Ordinances and
Chapters written below, which are for the recognition by day and by night
of those who are of the party and of the company of the said most Christian
king or prince; Also if other ships, either strangers or enemies, whether
sailing ships, galleys, foists or other vessels, should be found among the
said navy by day or night, they may be easily recognised by these said
ordinances, which must be well kept and observed by the whole fleet and
company of the said navy.</p>

<p>And First:</p>

<p>The King's ship, or that of his admiral and lieutenant if the said lord
is not himself present, shall ordinarily wear the banner in the top called
the "gabye" in the Levant; and this shall be the mark by which the royal
or admiral ship shall be recognised by day; and by night, because the
aforesaid banner can not be seen, the said ship shall carry on its poop a
lighted lantern, such as is called a "fanal" in the Levant waters, which
shall burn all night, so that the whole fleet can see it; and by this means the
royal or admiral ship shall be recognised by all the fleet.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
<p>Item, all the ships of the fleet, whether galleys or other vessels, shall
come each morning to salute the King's or admiral's ship and to ascertain
the watchword (mot du guet), and in the evening to learn the night-cry
(<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">cry de la nuyt</span>); and in the evening they shall come and salute the said
lord and his ship, and enquire what route and course he intends to follow,
in order that if, through tempest or for other reasons, any vessel should
lose itself by night, it will know what route to follow; and none of the said
ships or galleys, except the king's or admiral's, shall carry a banner in the
top, nor any lantern or beacon, except the Captain General of the galleys,
who usually may carry the banner at the stern, and by night a stern lantern.
If by chance bad weather should occur (which God forbid) and it is
feared that the vessels may become separated from one another, the king
will carry two banners by day and two lanterns by night, and each of his fleet
one; and in the same way the Captain of the galleys and his fleet one other.</p>

<p>Item, no ship shall fail to change its course and go about when the said
lord does so, and generally, each one shall perform the manoeuvre which
the said lord shall perform.</p>

<p>Item, if the said lord wishes to speak with other ships he will put a
banner at the stern, and each ship shall be bound to approach the said lord.
And if the said lord wishes to speak with the galleys only he will put the
banner in the admiral's stern gallery.</p>

<p>Item, let each one carry as much sail as seems good to him, and proceed
at the same speed as the said lord and no more, so that he does not
pass his said ship, under the penalty afore-mentioned or of being punished
at his discretion. And also let each one take care to keep near the said ship.</p>

<p>Item, if any of the said ships or galleys see one or more sail, the ships
shall show, as many times as they see sails, a banner in the top on that side
on which they see the said sails, and the galleys shall show it on the mast-head<a name="FNanchor_355" id="FNanchor_355"></a><a href="#Footnote_355" class="fnanchor">[355]</a>.
Each one of them, whether ship or galley, shall keep it there until
the captain<a name="FNanchor_356" id="FNanchor_356"></a><a href="#Footnote_356" class="fnanchor">[356]</a> has replied with a similar signal.</p>

<p>Item, let no one, on pain of death, whether commanding a ship, galley
or brigantine, chase any ship of any sort or condition without leave and
licence of the said lord.</p>

<p>Item, let no vessel salute another whilst it is within sight of the said
lord, on pain of corporal punishment, except the galleys, which shall salute
the Captain as a mark of respect.</p>

<p>Item, if by day any of the said ships or galleys shall have suffered any
damage (which God forbid) that one to which the accident has happened
shall place in the top a pendant so as to be seen by the said lord. It shall
fire one gun and shall keep the said banner flying until the other vessels
have come to its assistance. In the case of a galley it shall fly the said banner
at the masthead and shall fire one gun as already said, and each of the said
ships shall approach that to which the accident has happened in order to
render aid.</p>

<p>Item, if by chance the said ships have parted company, which God
forbid, and meet again by day, the one to windward shall lower and raise
the topsail once and fire one gun; and the one to leeward shall lower
and raise the said topsail once and fire two guns. In the case of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>galleys, the one to leeward<a name="FNanchor_357" id="FNanchor_357"></a><a href="#Footnote_357" class="fnanchor">[357]</a> shall twice draw up to the mast the lower end
of the lateen yard and shall fire one gun; and the one to leeward shall peak
the lateen yard (by drawing the upper end down to the corsia) and fire
two guns, keeping the said yard arm to the corsia<a name="FNanchor_358" id="FNanchor_358"></a><a href="#Footnote_358" class="fnanchor">[358]</a>.</p>

<p>Item, if any of the said ships is in need of aid from the galleys it shall
fire one gun and hoist a banner on the poop twice and the Captain of the
said galleys shall then, if possible, go or send to it.</p>

<p>Item. [If any of] the said ships or galleys sights land [the ship] shall
hoist a banner at the lower yard arm and the galley at the fore or at the
after end of the lateen yard slung horizontally<a name="FNanchor_359" id="FNanchor_359"></a><a href="#Footnote_359" class="fnanchor">[359]</a> on the side on which land
is seen, and shall keep it out until the said lord has answered.</p>

<p>Item, if the said lord wishes the said ships to lower their boats he will
place two banners at the poop and fire one gun, and immediately the said
ships shall launch their boats and put out towards the said lord or where
he shall wish them to go.</p>

<p>Item, if the said lord, being at anchor, wishes to make sail, he will
place a banner at the edge of the top in addition to the ordinary banner,
and will fire one gun, and everybody must thereupon return on board to
hoist sail likewise.</p>

<p>Item, if by day one or several sail are sighted, and the said lord wishes
the galleys to chase and speak with them, he will place a banner at each
yard-arm and fire two guns.</p>

<p>Item, if the said lord wishes the whole fleet to chase he will place two
banners at the said yard-arms, and also two more on the edge of the top
in addition to the ordinary one, and he will fire four guns, and every ship
shall be bound to carry the requisite number of sails.</p>

<p>Item, if the said lord and his fleet encounter enemy fleets where they
must fight, they shall show all the ensigns and banners they have, so that
each one may do his duty.</p>

<p>These articles will be changed every time that a fleet is set out, however
the substance of them remains the same.</p>

<p>Here follow the arrangements and chapters drawn up for night-time.</p>

<p>And first</p>

<p>If the said lord is at sea, and he wishes to make sail, he will show two
lanterns and will fire one gun, and he will keep the said lanterns showing
until the others have replied to him with two other lanterns, but without
firing guns; and each one shall be bound to get under way and make sail
like him.</p>

<p>Item, if, being under sail, the said lord wishes to speak with the other
ships, he will show two lanterns twice and twice conceal them; and the last
time he will keep them showing until the others have replied by a similar
signal, and each one shall be bound to go to the said lord; and if he wishes
to speak with the galleys only, he will show a single lantern over the stern
light, and if the brigantine is to come he will show two.</p>

<p>Item, if any of the said ships or galleys sight one or several sails it shall
show a single lantern as many times as it sees sails, and shall betake
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>itself to the said lord as soon as it can, and all the others shall do in like
manner.</p>

<p>Item, if the said lord wishes to take off a bonnet, he will show three
lanterns, one after the other, until the others have replied with three other
lanterns, and each one shall be bound to do the same.</p>

<p>Item, if the said lord wishes to set a bonnet and crowd on sail he will
show three lanterns one above the other and keep them out until the others
have answered with a similar signal, and each shall be bound to crowd on
sail to follow the said lord.</p>

<p>Item, if the said lord wishes to chase by night, he will show three lanterns
in a row three times, and will fire three guns, and will keep the said
lanterns showing until the others have replied by similar lanterns. And
to enable them to recognise one another each ship shall carry four lanterns
at the poop, and the said lord will carry three on each side of his stern light.</p>

<p>Item, if the said lord wishes to take in sail he will show three lanterns
one above the other three times, and will fire one gun, and the third time
he will keep the said lanterns showing until the others have replied by
similar lanterns without firing guns.</p>

<p>Item, if the said lord wishes to come into port, he will carry two stern
lights, one above the other, and will fire one gun, and each of the said
ships shall be bound to follow him to the said port; and when they shall
have followed him and anchored, the first ones must keep a lantern at the
stern until they have all arrived in the said port, in order that they may
not hinder one another; and when all the said ships have arrived they shall
take in the said lanterns, and the stern light of the said lord alone will
remain burning.</p>

<p>Item, if by night any accident shall occur to any one of the said ships
(which God forbid) it shall show four lanterns at the stern and four at the
bows, as it may be difficult to see all the said lanterns; it shall also fire two
guns until the other ships shall come to its aid, whereupon the said ships
shall be bound to come to its succour.</p>

<p>Item, if one of the said ships should have need of galleys, it shall fire
one gun and keep a lantern at the poop until the said galleys have arrived,
and the Captain of the said galleys shall be bound to go or send to it if it
is possible.</p>

<p>Item, if it should happen that the ships part company by any chance
(which God forbid) and they find their companions by night, the one to
windward shall show six lanterns three by three and shall fire two guns.</p>

<p>Item, the one to leeward shall show four lanterns one above the other
and fire four guns; and the watchword for the night shall be cried; and
thus each one will be easily recognised without having to come right up
with one another; and the said lord wills and commands that when the
fleet thus part company and find one another by night, and some distance
off find another ship not belonging to their company, none shall dare to
fire at one another without first having made the above signals, as well by
day as by night; and moreover, the said lord wills and commands that they
shall, in addition, speak with one another.</p>

<p>The watchword or cry for the night, and all the other signals, as well
for day as for night, are changed and are at the discretion and will of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
lord and chief of the said fleet, with the council of master mariners and
pilots, and with the aforesaid council and the assistance of this present
collection, they can make use of as much as seems good to them.</p>
</div>

<p>The instructions just quoted are plainly an ideal set; they represent
the best experience of the age, but there is no indication that
they were ever actually employed at sea.</p>

<p>The other important set of instructions of the early sixteenth
century is by no means so full as that of Conflans, but it was actually
used at sea, and reappears in various guises until the middle of the
century. It seems to have been first drawn up by Philippe de Cleves,
to have been used by the Emperor Charles V in his voyage from
Flanders to Spain in 1517, and finally to have been incorporated,
with slight alterations by Jehan Bytharne, Gunner in Ordinary to
the King of France, in his <cite>Livre de Guerre tant par mer que par terre</cite><a name="FNanchor_360" id="FNanchor_360"></a><a href="#Footnote_360" class="fnanchor">[360]</a>
written in 1543. The flag signals, which Bytharne says he had himself
seen made at sea, present no improvement on those already cited,
and they may, as given by Bytharne, be summarised as follows:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span></p>

<p>If we now turn to the contemporary instructions of the English
navy as given by Audley in his <cite>Orders to be used in the King's
Majesties Navy by the Sea</cite> (c. 1530)<a name="FNanchor_363" id="FNanchor_363"></a><a href="#Footnote_363" class="fnanchor">[363]</a>, we are at once struck by the primitive
nature of the signals contained in them. They are as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Whensoever, and at all tymes the Admyrall doth shote of a pece of
Ordinance, and set up his Banner of Councell on Starrborde bottocke<a name="FNanchor_364" id="FNanchor_364"></a><a href="#Footnote_364" class="fnanchor">[364]</a> of
his Shippe, everie shipps capten shall with spede go aborde the Admyrall
to know his will.</p>

<p>When and at all tymes the Admyrall will anker or disanker, he must
shote a pece, that thereby the rest may know to do the same; and that no
Shippe ride in an others walke, for in that is greate danger.</p>

<p>If they saile by night the Admirall must beare a greate light in the
stearne of his Shippe, and if his fleete be greate, the Admirall must carie
ij lights; and the Vice Admirall one, and the said Admirall must make
such Saile over night that all his fleet may kepe about him; perchanse ells
in the morning a greate parte of his flete may be out of his sight, for everie
Shippe saileth not alike.</p>

<p>If it chance any Shippe in the night fall in leake, or breake his maste,
he may shote a pece of Ordinance, or ij to warne the flete he hath harme
and in perall, to the entent he may have helpe, and the rest to tarie.</p>

<p>The Admyrall ought to have a swifte pynnes abord alwaies abrod to
askrie so farre of that he may se the flete out of his toppe, and if he seeth
any enemyes or any other sailes, geve knowlege to the Admyrall if they be
any enemyes let him shote ij or iij peces of; in the meanetyme the Flete
may put them self in order and councel before hand. Allwaies foreseing the
pynnesse prease not so nighe the enemve that he might be apprehended,
for by that the secrets might be knowne to the enemye, and evrie night
he to cum into the flete agayne.</p>

<p>If in the night there chanseth any enemyes unlooked for to fall into the
flete, he that first doth askrie the same shall shote of ij peces, and geve a
token of ij fyers and by that token shal be understande that they be
enemyes that be in the Flete. Yf they do flee, let everie man make after,
and that Shippe that is nighest beare a light in his Stearnye that the rest
may know whether<a name="FNanchor_365" id="FNanchor_365"></a><a href="#Footnote_365" class="fnanchor">[365]</a> the enemye goeth, for otherwise they may lose them:
and if he that giveth the chace, se not the fleete follow, let him shoote of
a pece, that they may follow by his shotte, in case they should not see his
light.</p>

<p>The Admyrall ought to have this order before he joyne battell w<sup>th</sup> the
enemye that all his shipps shall beare a flagge in their missentoppe and himself
one in the foremaste beside the Mayne mast, that everie man may know
his owne flete by that token....</p>
</div>

<p>Scanty and insufficient as are these signals, and they leave everything
to "councel" beforehand, there was no marked improvement
on them until the days of the Commonwealth and the First Dutch
War. The Instructions drawn up by Wynter<a name="FNanchor_366" id="FNanchor_366"></a><a href="#Footnote_366" class="fnanchor">[366]</a> in the last year of
Queen Mary's reign contain only one flag signal&mdash;the banner of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>council&mdash;one night signal for change of course, which is of interest
as showing that the primitive cresset was, in 1558, still in use in the
English fleet:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Item, in the night we do change our Course then the Admiral will bear
a light in his Cresset for the space of one hour, whereby every Man may
know what he ought to do; And all the night after none, and then he will
show out a Lanthorn with a Candle light in the Mizon Shrowds.</p>
</div>

<p class="no-indent">one elementary recognition signal:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Item, if any be separated as before said, and that they descry by fortune
one another, to the end they may be assured that they are of one Company
the one shall strike his foresail, and a Yaw<a name="FNanchor_367" id="FNanchor_367"></a><a href="#Footnote_367" class="fnanchor">[367]</a>, and to howse it and strike it in
that sort, until he do think that the same be seen unto the other, and then
shall the other answer him by striking of his foresail, and shooting of one
good piece, so that by the signs they shall be certain the one of the other.</p>
</div>

<p class="no-indent">and one signal for use in fog, that seems as inefficient as the others:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Item, if there do happen any great Mists, in such sort, that one cannot
discern another, then according to the weather, or place we be in, we must
order ourselves, that is to wit, if there be so room. The Admiral will strike
his Sail, and shoot one piece then, whereby every Man may be warned to
do the same, and if the Admiral will anchor, then he will shoot off two
pieces, one after another, and strike the Sail incontinent upon the same,
but if it so fortune that he can neither drive nor ride at Anchor, then every
man mark well at the beginning of the mist what course the Admiral
keepeth, and to do the same. And the said Admiral will within every Glass
running shoot one piece for acknowledge, and because one may be the
better warned of another, ye shall make noise with trumpets, drums, or
knocking.</p>
</div>

<p>If any tactical instructions were issued to the fleet that engaged
the Spanish Armada they have not been preserved to us, but there is
no reason to suppose that they were&mdash;or would have been&mdash;any less
rudimentary than those we have just considered. They may be taken
to be represented by the "Rules in Sir John Hawkins his tyme"
preserved among the State Papers of James I<a name="FNanchor_368" id="FNanchor_368"></a><a href="#Footnote_368" class="fnanchor">[368]</a>:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>5. Item that the fleetest pynassis doe waight still on the Admirall and
be at hand y<sup>t</sup> he maye upon all occasions send them from shipp to shipp as
hee shall see Cause.</p>

<p>12. Item that upon the settinge up of a flagge in the quarter of y<sup>e</sup>
Admiralls shipp every shipp come and speak w<sup>h</sup> the Admirall.</p>

<p>13. Item that when the Admirall shall set up his flag of Counsell in
the shrowdes That then every Captayne shall repaire to knowe his pleasure.</p>

<p>14. Item when the Admirall shall cause a pece of ordinance to be shot
of and a flagge of Counsell to be put out upon the mayne yard then shall
all the other shipp reporte to the Admirall and the Captaynes w<sup>h</sup> their
M<sup>r</sup> shall come in their boats aboard the Admirall.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span></p>

<p>19. Item If it fortune a strange shipp to fall into the fleet by night,
that you dowbt them, you shall call unto them for the watchword. And if
he or they have not the same then you shall hange up two lights one above
the other on the same side of the shipp w<sup>h</sup> you shall perceave them of, so
as the rest of y<sup>e</sup> shipp maye have warninge accordingly.</p>
</div>

<p>There is no provision in these "Rules" for any communication
by signalling. All orders are given either by word of mouth or by
sending a message by a pinnace.</p>

<p>The Instructions<a name="FNanchor_369" id="FNanchor_369"></a><a href="#Footnote_369" class="fnanchor">[369]</a> for the Cadiz Expedition of 1596, elaborate as
they are in certain directions, provide few signals. There was, of
course, the "Flag of Council," half-mast high against the mizen-mast:
the royal standard for the "selected" council, and the
St George for all captains and masters. Each squadronal admiral
might call the captains and masters of his own squadron to his flagship
for orders by removing the white pendant (with which all ships
were provided) from his mizen yard and hanging it in the main yard
"two men's height." If a strange sail was sighted the nearest ship
might chase it, but not more than one was to do so unless the admiral
of the squadron signalled for two or three to go, by hanging out two
or three flags (presumably any flags that were handy) one over the
other. If the squadronal admiral himself bore up and chased, all
might follow unless the Generals (Essex or Howard) hung out the
flag of council, when all were to give over and keep their course. As
a recognition signal, a ship that had lost company was to strike and
hoist the maintopsail twice, or in bad weather the main mizen twice
or as often as they liked.</p>

<p>The Instructions issued on various occasions during the next
fifty years present few points that concern us. They never contain
more than two or three signals, and those only of the type with which
we are already sufficiently familiar. It may, however, be of interest
to note the various forms taken by the "Flag of Council." In the
Orders drawn up by Raleigh in 1617 for his expedition to Guiana
the form of this flag is not indicated, apparently any flag might serve
the purpose:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>When the Admirall shall hang out a flagg in the main shrowdes, you
shall knowe it to be a flagg of counsell; then come aboard him<a name="FNanchor_370" id="FNanchor_370"></a><a href="#Footnote_370" class="fnanchor">[370]</a>.</p>
</div>

<p>For the voyage of Prince Charles to Spain in 1623 and for the
Cadiz Expedition of 1625 the arrangement was the same as in 1596&mdash;the
royal standard for the Council of War, or select council of the
principal officers, and the St George for a general council of all
captains and masters&mdash;but in August, 1628, Buckingham substituted
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>the Union, or, as he called it, the "Brittish," flag for the St George
in calling the general council. In September of that year, however,
the Earl of Lindsey was using the Union flag for the Council of
War and the St George for the council of Captains and Masters.
The orders drawn up by Pennington in 1631 and in 1639 present a
fresh variation, the separation of the Captains from the Masters:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>44. Whensoever you shall see the Brittish flagg spred in my myson
shrowds, then all the Captains are to come aboard of me. If the Red
Antient then both the Captains and Masters.</p>
</div>

<p>In 1635 Lindsey used the Union flag for the General Council,
or Council of War, but the signal for captains and masters was altered
to the red ensign, and this form was adopted by the Earl of Northumberland
in 1636.</p>

<p>Before we proceed to consider the signals of the First Dutch War,
which heralded a new era, it will be desirable to refer to those contained
in the <cite>Dialogues</cite> of Nathaniel Boteler. Boteler had served as
captain in the Cadiz Expedition of 1625 and in the Rochelle Expedition
of 1627, and seems to have written the first draft of the <cite>Dialogues</cite>
shortly after the latter event. Judging from the manuscripts that
remain, he re-wrote parts of them at various times until 1634, but
his remarks on signals remain practically unaltered<a name="FNanchor_371" id="FNanchor_371"></a><a href="#Footnote_371" class="fnanchor">[371]</a>, and may be
taken to represent the ideal of English seamanship of that period.
On comparing them with Conflans' suggested instructions of 1515
it will be seen that the English ideal was by no means a high one, yet
it was not surpassed until the Commonwealth Instructions were
issued in 1654.</p>

<p>Speaking in guise of a seaman "Captain," who is instructing a
court "Admiral" in his duties, Boteler says:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>In the first place therfore, when the Generall entends upon such a daye
to make out to Sea with his whole Fleete; a fitt Signall to expresse as much
to every perticuler shypp may be, by causeinge his Topp-sayles to lie
loose upon the Capps, very early that morneinge; and if itt prove to be
hazie and darcke weather, soe that the fleete being great, or lieing scattered
att an Anchor, may not well perceive it, Hee may then, about two or three
houres before he begin to waye his Anchors cause fire to be given to a
single Piece of Ordinance.</p>

<p>Secondly, if a fleete being att sea, and occasions require a generall
convention of the Captaines and Masters aborde the Admiralls shypp:
A fitt signall to lett them know itt may be, to hang out a yellow flagge in the
uppermost part of the Admiralls Maine Shrowdes: But if ther be entended
only the comeinge aborde of the Counsell of Warre, then may ther be a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
blewe flagge hung out in the same place; for I conceive that this part is
more proper then is the Missen Shrowdes, (though that be the most
received place for this purpose) in regard that itt is more perceptable and
may better be discovered.</p>

<p>Thirdly, if the Generall shall finde cause, to cast about in the night
(for if by daye, this asketh noe signall) besides the Light or Lanthorne,
which every Admirall is to carry in the Poope, the most evidenceinge
signe that I can thincke of may be, to put another light in the Maine-topp:
And if Hee entend to lie a-Hull, to shewe two lights in the same
place: If a-Trie, three lights, the which lights are soe to be carried untill itt
be founde that the whole Fleete hathe taken notice of itt, and answere itt
accordingly.</p>

<p>Fourthly, If any Squadron or parte of the fleete, by beinge too forwards
a-heade, shall be required to shorten sayle, and to attend the comeinge
up of the Admirall; a Signe appropriated may be, to heave or wave
an Ensigne abroade in the Admiralls Fore-topp, and to give fire to a great
piece withall; And on the contrary, whensoever any of them keepe too
farre a-sterne, to wave out the same flagge in the Missen-topp.</p>

<p>Fifthly, If upon the discoverye of any straunge fleete or Shyp, the
Generall find itt fitt to have any of the Pinnaces, and best saylers of his
fleete, to stand in with them, and to require them to come to speake with
him; an apte signe may be to give fire to a piece of Ordinance or two out
of his own chase, and withall to shewe a flagge in his Bolt sprites Topp.</p>

<p>Sixthly, Whensoever a Fleete shall meet with the Enemies fleete, and
after due consultation aborde the Admirall, itt shall be found fitt to fight,
the Admirall may take in his ordinary Ensigne from the poope of the shyp
and hang out another all redd, which is tearmed the bloudy Colors; that
soe all the fleete may dispose and order themselves to fall on upon the
Enemie in such forme and fashion as they are before hand to be instructed
in.</p>

<p>And thes are such necessary Causes, to require any signalls to be
expressed by the Generall himselfe, out of his perticuler Shypp: It
followes, to intimate in some other perticulers, wherin every perticuler
shypp of the fleete is to doe the like; hereby as well to give notice to the
Generall himselfe or any of the rest.</p>

<p><em>Admiral.</em> And what are thes?</p>

<p><em>Captain.</em> If any Shyp of a fleete shall discover any straunge fleete, or
any Squadron of straunge Shypps, or any single Shyp whatsoever; itt being
necessary that not only the Generall, but the whole Armadoe, should with
all expedition, receive advertisement hereof. A convenient signall to this
purpose may be, to shewe abroade some flagge in that part of that Shyp
which pointeth most upon the discovered Straunger; and if it be a fleete
that is soe discovered, then to hang out two flagges in the same manner,
and withall to give to a great Gunne or two, that so notice may generally
be taken of what is done.</p>

<p>Likewise, whensoever a fleete comeinge out of the Sea, expecteth a
Landfall: the first Shyp of them that maketh Land is to give present
notice therof to all the rest of the fleete; and this she is to doe, if itt be by
daye, by shewinge her Colors abroade, though itt be (for the time) in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
Maine-topp itt selfe, inclineinge and bendinge them towards that part
whence Land is discovered; and if this discovery happen in the night,
she is to shoote of two pieces of Ordinance and withall shewe a light
abroade; and instantly cast about and stand off, that the residue of the
fleete may take notice and beware.</p>

<p>If any Shyp of a fleete shall find her selfe in daunger of founderinge
in the Sea, by springeinge of a leake, or any the like mischaunce; if this
bee by daye shee maye shoote off three pieces of Ordinance, and withall
cause a youncker to goe upp to the Maine-topp and shewe a waft: And if
this happen in the night time; then to continue this shooteinge ever and
anon of a single piece, and withall to shewe a light, that notice may be
taken by the Gunne and her selfe found out by the light, and so relieved.
And because ther may be many occasions wherby a fleete may be far dispersed,
and yet afterwards gett togither againe, and that itt is fitt, that upon
the first ken one of another, they may be knowne one unto another and soe
noe mistakeinges ensue, an apt Signall to this purpose, may be by the
puttinge out and takeinge in of a flagge soe many times one after another
as shall formerly be agreed upon, or by the soe often strikeinge of a Topp-sayle
or the like; the which they are to answer one unto another.</p>
</div>

<p>Boteler's suggestion of yellow and blue flags as signals for calling
a Council is of especial interest as being the earliest proposal to use
special flags for making signals. Until the year 1654, signals&mdash;at any
rate in English fleets&mdash;were with two exceptions always made with
the flags already in use for other purposes, that is, with the Flags of
Command or Colours of Distinction, whose primary uses we have
already discussed. These two exceptions are the red flag of war and
the white flag of peace.</p>

<p>The red flag, or "bloody colours" as it was often called, and the
white flag are not mentioned in any of the early instructions. They
were, in fact, international signals and formed part of the traditional
"Custom of the Sea" which was never completely codified and,
except so far as it was gathered into such collections as the Rooles
d'Oléron and the Consolado del Mar, can now only be recovered
by the laborious process of collecting precedents.</p>

<p>The red flag, could we completely trace its descent, would no
doubt be found to have sprung from the "scarlet cloak" which the
ancient Greek navy seems to have borrowed from the Phoenicians,
but we first meet with it, so far as English ships are concerned, in
the document of <em>circa</em> 1299 referred to above<a name="FNanchor_372" id="FNanchor_372"></a><a href="#Footnote_372" class="fnanchor">[372]</a> in which is set forth
the injuries inflicted by the Normans on the shipping of England,
Ireland and Gascony (then subject to the English crown). In April
a fleet of English, Irish and Bayonne merchantmen set out from
Portsmouth bound for Bordeaux. Off St Mathieu, on the coast of
Brittany, they anchored. According to their own story, they were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
becalmed. News of their presence reached a fleet of 290 ships of
Normandy, then loading wine in the river Charente. Leaving half
their cargoes, in order that their sailing might not be impeded, the
Normans fitted up fore and after castles and fighting tops at the mastheads
and hoisted streamers of red sendal two yards broad and thirty
yards long, called "baucans," as a sign that no quarter would be
given<a name="FNanchor_373" id="FNanchor_373"></a><a href="#Footnote_373" class="fnanchor">[373]</a>. A southerly wind having now sprung up the Normans fell
upon the other fleet, only to receive a thorough beating. In refusing
to give up the spoils taken on this occasion, the allies explained to
Edward I that when the "baucan" had been raised in an engagement of
this kind no one could be held responsible for life or property taken<a name="FNanchor_374" id="FNanchor_374"></a><a href="#Footnote_374" class="fnanchor">[374]</a>.</p>

<p>Although the red flag was a recognised signal for combat among
all European nations, it was not until the year 1647 that it was
formally included in the English "Instructions." It remained in
them until the year 1799.</p>

<p>In the West Indies, so Cleirac tells us, the Spanish flag of combat
was blue: in European waters it was red, with the arms of Castile
upon it.</p>

<p>The flag of peace, or truce, seems to have been adopted at sea
about the end of the fifteenth century, but although it may be regarded
from one point of view as a signal it will be convenient to
defer our consideration of it until we come to deal with the flag
incidents connected with the surrender of a ship<a name="FNanchor_375" id="FNanchor_375"></a><a href="#Footnote_375" class="fnanchor">[375]</a>.</p>

</div><div>

<h4><a name="Chapter_VIb" id="Chapter_VIb"></a><a href="#CONTENTS">(ii) THE FIRST ENGLISH CODES</a>
<a name="FNanchor_376" id="FNanchor_376"></a><a href="#Footnote_376" class="fnanchor">[376]</a></h4>

<p>It is evident from the foregoing sketch of the early history of
flag signals that up to the middle of the seventeenth century the
signals of the English navy were of the most elementary description.
The first steps towards the introduction of a more efficient system
were taken in 1647 when the "Right Honourable the Committee of
the Lords and Commons for the Admiralty and Cinque Ports"
issued "Instructions" on a more elaborate plan. The general instructions,
dated 6th April, 1647, are preserved; but, unfortunately,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>the "Instructions for sailing," issued at the same time, which contained
the signals, have not yet been brought to light. From the
"supplementary instructions" preserved in the Harleian <span class="smcap">mss.</span>, and
printed by Sir Julian Corbett<a name="FNanchor_377" id="FNanchor_377"></a><a href="#Footnote_377" class="fnanchor">[377]</a>, it may be inferred that the British
navy was at length drawing on a level with the navies of France and
Spain in respect to its method of communicating orders.</p>

<p>In 1653 a further great improvement was made<a name="FNanchor_378" id="FNanchor_378"></a><a href="#Footnote_378" class="fnanchor">[378]</a>, and a "code"
of instructions, with the accompanying signals, now appears, issued
"By the Right Honourable the Generals and Admirals of the Fleet,"
and signed by Blake, Deane, and Monk. The following were the
flags to be used for signals: A weft of the ensign or jack, a pendant,
and the three flags&mdash;red, blue, and white&mdash;already in existence as
flags of command.</p>

<p>The signal to "Engage the enemy," doubtless that used by Monk
in fighting Tromp, and by Blake in his last glorious action of Santa
Cruz, was made "by shooting-off two guns and putting a red flag
over the fore topmast-head."</p>

<p>This Commonwealth code was further expanded in 1665, under
the guidance of the Duke of York, afterwards King James II. In a
supplementary order of the same year, a red and white striped flag
first appears as the signal to chase. In 1672 and 1673 the instructions
and signals were further amplified and then printed, being possibly
the first set of naval fighting instructions to be put into print.</p>

<p>In a finely bound manuscript copy of the 1673 Instructions, now
in the Admiralty Library, which, from internal evidence, was prepared
about 1689, we have the earliest surviving example of the
"signal book" proper. Hitherto the signals had been embodied in
the various Articles of Sailing and Fighting Instructions, the appropriate
flag being merely described in the text of each article, but no
diagram or coloured representation of the flag being given. In this
<span class="smcap">ms.</span> we have for the first time coloured drawings of flags arranged in
order, with the meaning and place where hoisted against each in
parallel <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;original text: coloumns">columns</ins>, a convenient method of systematising the signals
that was not followed in the official printed "Instructions" for a
century.</p>

<p>The flags of the manuscript are as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="no-indent">Union Flag.<br />
The Standard.<br />
Red Ensign.<br />
Blue Ensign.<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>White Ensign.<br />
Dutch Ensign (red, white, and blue in three horizontal stripes).<br />
A flag striped red and yellow from corner to corner.<br />
Red flag.<br />
Blue flag.<br />
White flag.<br />
A "Jack coloured with colours." (This was a "Union Jack," or small Union flag.)<br />
A pendant.<br />
A flag striped red and white horizontally.<br />
A flag striped red and white from corner to corner.<br />
White with red diagonal cross.</p>
</div>

<p>In other copies of the 1673 Instructions the last four are omitted,
but a flag striped yellow and white from corner to corner is mentioned
as a signal for fireships.</p>

<p>The Instructions of 1673 formed the basis of the instructions for
the next hundred years. They were issued in a revised form by
Admiral Russell in 1691 when the following signal flags were added:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="no-indent">Yellow.<br />
Striped yellow and white horizontally.<br />
Red and white.<br />
Genoese Ensign (similar to an elongated St. George's flag).</p>
</div>

<p>Russell's instructions were adopted by Rooke in 1703 with but
slight modification of the articles and with no change in the flags.</p>

<p>The year 1714 saw the issue of the first printed "Signal Book."
This was a private venture of one Jonathan Greenwood. The author
justifiably boasts that he has "disposed matters in such a manner
that any instruction may be found out in half a minute," and that
he has "made it a pocket volume that it may be at hand upon all
occasions." No doubt this duodecimo book was much more convenient
than the folio size Instructions. Each signal is represented by a
drawing of a ship flying the flag or flags of the signal at the proper
place, the purport being added underneath, a method which appears
to have been in use in the French navy at least 20 years earlier, for
a Signal Book of 1693, containing De Tourville's signals arranged on
this plan, was exhibited at the Franco-British Exhibition in 1908.
Although the instructions were regarded as confidential the signals
apparently were not, as the work is described as "designed to supply
the Inferior Officers who cannot have recourse to the Printed Instructions."</p>

<p>The next "Signal Book" proper was again a private venture and
was published by John Millan in 1746, "price 2<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> plain and 4<i>s.</i>
coloured." In this book the flags are set out along the tops of the
pages, and the signals made with them are classified below, according<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
to the different positions of the flags, with references to the numbers
of the articles of the various Instructions&mdash;"Sailing," "Fighting,"
and "Additional"&mdash;in which the signals are laid down. The only
new flags appearing here are the following:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="no-indent">White cross on red ground.<br />
Red cross on blue ground.<br />
Blue and white in two horizontal stripes.<br />
Red and white in two horizontal stripes.</p>
</div>

<p>In a manuscript signal book of ten years later, in the Library of the
Royal United Service Institution, we have the earliest representation
of a "chequered" flag. This book is interesting. It contains Hawke's
autograph, and is possibly the one in use by him when he "came
sweeping from the West" at Quiberon. The following are the flags
then first appearing:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="no-indent">Red, white, and blue in six horizontal stripes.<br />
Spanish flag.<br />
Blue and white in five horizontal stripes.<br />
Red and white chequered.<br />
Blue with six white balls<a name="FNanchor_379" id="FNanchor_379"></a><a href="#Footnote_379" class="fnanchor">[379]</a>.<br />
Yellow and blue chequered.<br />
Blue and white chequered pendant.</p>
</div>

<p>During the course of this&mdash;the "Seven Years'"&mdash;war a number
of "additional" sailing and fighting instructions were issued by the
Admiralty, to which the Admirals in command of fleets made some
additions of their own. The advance made by the end of the war is
indicated by a manuscript signal book dated 1762 containing the
"General Printed and Additional Signals delivered out by Sir Edward
Hawke." It illustrates the following flags:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="no-indent">Standard.<br />
Union.<br />
Red Ensign (called the "English Ensign").<br />

Spanish flag.<br />
Red pendant.<br />
Red and white striped pendant.</p>
</div>

<p class="no-indent">To which, though they are not illustrated, were added a blue pendant
and a white pendant.</p>

<p>Development of signals henceforth became very rapid, and new
flags had to be invented to keep up with them. This is well seen in
the signal book used by Rodney in his memorable fight with De
Grasse in 1782. Here we have, in addition to flags already mentioned,
the following new ones:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="no-indent">Red and white, quarterly.<br />
Blue and white, quarterly.<br />
Red and blue, quarterly.<br />
*Red and blue, two horizontal stripes.<br />

<p>In addition to these the white and blue ensigns were also to be
used for signalling purposes.</p>

<p>The flags marked * were also used inverted, as were also the two-striped
red and white and blue and white flags already in use.</p>

<p>The signal to "Prepare for battle" was the red flag at the main
topgallant masthead under the Admiral's flag.</p>

<p>To "Engage the enemy"; the same flag at the fore top masthead,
just as in 1653.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span></p>
<p>"To come to a closer engagement"; the blue and white flag (two
horizontal stripes) at the fore topgallant masthead under the signal
for engaging.</p>

<p>In this code we reach the culmination of the old system of signalling
by means of a large number of different flags each having a
different meaning according to the position in which it was shown.</p>

</div><div>

<h4><a name="Chapter_VIc" id="Chapter_VIc"></a><a href="#CONTENTS">(iii) THE INVENTION OF NUMERARY SIGNALS</a></h4>

<p>The development of tactics and fleet organisation and the consequent
increase of the signals had been so rapid during the latter
half of the eighteenth century that the old methods had become inadequate.
In 1746 there were 16 flags in use to express 144 signals, by
1780 there were about 50 flags, each hoisted on an average in seven
different positions, providing for about 330 signals. Twenty-five
years later the Trafalgar signal book contained upwards of 400, not
including those in Popham's Code.</p>

<p>So long as the signals were few in number, so that the flags could
be made in a few strongly contrasted designs, and only the most
prominent positions need be used for them, the old system had the
advantage of simplicity, but when the signals multiplied, less conspicuous
positions and less strikingly differentiated flags had also to
be made use of, and simplicity gave place to complexity.</p>

<p>It must be remembered that flags at sea have to be distinguished
not only when a fair breeze is unfurling them plainly to the view;
they have also to be distinguished in a dead calm when they hang
down along the halyards, and when distance and haze lend enchantment
to the view but not to the signalman.</p>

<p>In order that the differences in the flags may be readily
distinguishable at sea in any circumstances two conditions are
essential&mdash;</p>

<p>(1) The colours must be quite unlike, so that they do not "merge"
at a distance.</p>

<p>(2) The designs of the flags must be simple and not complicated.</p>

<p>In practice this limits the colours to the following: Red, blue,
and yellow, with black and white. Moreover, it is found that when
two of these colours are to be shown in one flag they should be of
one of the following combinations: red and white, yellow and blue,
blue and white, or black and white. But with so many as 40 flags it
was impossible to adhere to these two rules.</p>

<p>The fact that no further development on old lines was possible
was, no doubt, widely comprehended; for Admiral Sir Chas Knowles
tells us that it was the Marquis of Hastings, an officer in the Army,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
then in America, who first advised him to "strike out something
new." The first steps in the new direction were taken about 1778 by
Kempenfelt, Howe, and Sir Chas Knowles, each acting more or
less independently. There is no need to waste time in discussing the
rival claims of these admirals to be the inventor of the numerary
method, because as a matter of fact this method of denoting signals
had been invented by Mahé de la Bourdonnais, 40 years before, for
use in the struggle he was preparing to wage with us for the mastery
of India and the East Indies. La Bourdonnais was one of the most
brilliant and versatile officers that France has produced; but he was
of somewhat obscure birth when compared with the high nobility
who at that period officered the French navy, and he had been
admitted to their ranks by a back door, having first served in the
French East India Company. Fortunately for Great Britain, the
jealousy of Dupleix and of La Bourdonnais' high-born brother officers
thwarted his plans, and finally resulted in his recall to France. His
signals seem never to have been adopted<a name="FNanchor_381" id="FNanchor_381"></a><a href="#Footnote_381" class="fnanchor">[381]</a>, but the system is described
by Bourdé de Villehuet in his book, <cite>Le Manœuvrier</cite>, published in
1769, one of the classic works on tactics of the eighteenth century.
It is evident from an extract in one of his letters to Lord Barham
that it was from this source that Kempenfelt became acquainted with
the system.</p>

<p>The claim of Admiral Sir Chas Knowles to have "discovered the
signals by numbers" in 1778, which numeral signals he gave to Lord
Howe on his arrival at Newport, Rhode Island, may therefore be
dismissed, so far as discovery is concerned, but his claims to have
"discovered the tabular flags (suggested by a chessboard)" may
possibly hold good.</p>

<p>Sir Chas Knowles's signals were not adopted in the navy, but as
we shall find "tabular flags" used in the Signal Books of Howe, it
will be well to explain the two methods.</p>

<p>When a signal code has been drawn up and the signals have been
numbered consecutively, the numbers may be represented by flags
in two different ways.</p>

<p>The simple numerary method, that invented by La Bourdonnais
and finally adopted by Howe for his principal signals, is to assign
one flag to each of the figures 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 0; so that by
combining the flags any desired signal number may be rendered.</p>

<p>The other, the tabular method, for which Sir Chas Knowles
claims the credit of invention, is more complicated. A chequered
table like a chessboard is ruled out, each side having a convenient<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
number of squares, 8, 9, 10, or more. Then, choosing the same number
of flags, these are laid out in order along the top, commencing at the
left-hand corner, and also down the left side. The signal numbers are
then placed in the squares of this table.</p>

<p>There will then obviously be two flags corresponding to each of
the numbers, the top flag being that at the head of the vertical column
in which the particular number is found, and the lower one that at
the left of the corresponding horizontal column. For example, supposing
we have three flags, red, white, and blue, they might be arranged
as below:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<table border="0" cellpadding="1" cellspacing="0" summary="Numerary Flags">
<tr><td align="center"></td><td align="center">Red</td><td align="center">White</td><td align="center">Blue</td></tr>
<tr><td align="center">Red</td><td align="center">1</td><td align="center">4</td><td align="center">7</td></tr>
<tr><td align="center">White</td><td align="center">2</td><td align="center">5</td><td align="center">8</td></tr>
<tr><td align="center">Blue</td><td align="center">3</td><td align="center">6</td><td align="center">9</td></tr>
</table></div>

<p>The signal corresponding to 6 will then be a white flag over a
blue one.</p>

<p>If the signals to be thus denoted number considerably more than
100, it is convenient to form the table of 10 squares to a side, giving
100 squares in all. The first 100 numbers will then be written
in, and by the addition of suitable pendants to represent 100, 200,
300, etc., it will be possible to denote any signal number from
1 upwards.</p>

<p>The disadvantage of this method is that the individual flags have
no fixed numerical value, and a reference to the table is necessary
before the number represented by the combined flags can be ascertained,
and <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">vice versâ</i>.</p>

<p>In spite of this drawback, this was the method first chosen by
Howe for all his signals<a name="FNanchor_382" id="FNanchor_382"></a><a href="#Footnote_382" class="fnanchor">[382]</a>, and it was used by him in his second
numerary code for those of his signals which were intended for the
use of private ships when communicating with the flagships, the
numeral signals of the La Bourdonnais method being in this code
only used for the Admiral's orders to his fleet. In the 1799 Signal
Book the tabular method was discontinued.</p>

<p>Some time before June, 1776, probably on being appointed to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
command the North America Squadron in February of that year,
Howe had compiled a signal book on the old plan of single flags in
particular positions, condensed from the "general signal book," and
containing all the signals "likely to be needful on the present occasion."</p>

<p>The flags he employed were as follows, those marked * being also
used inverted:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="no-indent">Union.<br />
St George.<br />
Red &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;}<br />
Yellow } plain flags.<br />
Blue &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; }<br />
White &nbsp;&nbsp;}<br />
*Red and white&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; }<br />
*Red and blue &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; }<br />
*Blue and white &nbsp; } in two horizontal stripes.<br />
*Red and yellow &nbsp;}<br />
*Blue and yellow }<br />
*Red, blue, white &nbsp; }<br />
*White, red, blue &nbsp;&nbsp;} in three horizontal stripes.<br />
Blue, white, red &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;}</p>
</div>

<p>A year or two later, probably in consultation with Kempenfelt,
he drew up the first of his codes on the numerary system. The signals
were divided into those for the Admiral and those for private ships.
For the former a "table" of 16 squares on each side was employed
with the following flags:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="no-indent"><span class="pad05">1. Yellow cross on blue ground.</span><br />
<span class="pad05">2. Blue and yellow quarterly.</span><br />
<span class="pad05">3. Blue cross on yellow.</span><br />
<span class="pad05">4. Yellow.</span><br />
<span class="pad05">5. Blue and yellow chequered.</span><br />
<span class="pad05">6. White and red in two vertical stripes.</span><br />
<span class="pad05">7. Red, white, and red in three vertical stripes.</span><br />
<span class="pad05">8. Yellow and blue in two vertical stripes.</span><br />
<span class="pad05">9. White cross on red.</span><br />
10. Red and white chequered.<br />
11. Red and white in two horizontal stripes.<br />
12. Red and white quarterly.<br />
13. Blue and yellow in two horizontal stripes.<br />
14. Red.<br />
15. Blue, yellow, blue, in three vertical stripes.<br />
16. Yellow, blue, yellow, in three horizontal stripes.</p>
</div>

<p>The signals for "private" ships were mostly on the old plan of
single flags in particular positions.</p>

<p>To express numbers, as in the number of ships seen, depth of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
water, latitude and longitude, a "table" of 10 squares each side was
employed. The flags of this were as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="no-indent"><span class="pad15">1. Union.</span><br />
<span class="pad15">2. Red.</span><br />
<span class="pad15">3. White.</span><br />
<span class="pad15">4. Blue.</span><br />
<span class="pad15">5. Red and white.</span><br />
<span class="pad15">6. Blue and yellow.</span><br />
<span class="pad15">7. Red, white, and blue.</span><br />
<span class="pad15">8. Red pendant.</span><br />
<span class="pad15">9. Yellow pendant.</span><br />
<span class="pad1">10. Red, white, and blue pendant,</span><br />
and a blue pendant to represent 100 for use in numbers from 101 upwards.</p>
</div>

<p>It will be noted that three of the most unsuitable of Rodney's
flags, the quarterly red and blue, striped red and blue, and the red
with blue cross, each of which would look like purple at a distance,
had disappeared.</p>

<p>About the same date Kempenfelt produced his own numerary
code. He tells Lord Barham, in a letter dated March, 1781<a name="FNanchor_383" id="FNanchor_383"></a><a href="#Footnote_383" class="fnanchor">[383]</a>, that the
plan he followed was not that he most approved of.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>That which I would have adopted&mdash;though most evidently the best&mdash;I
could not get any of the Admirals or Officers of note to approve and
countenance. I therefore followed in a great measure Lord Howe's mode,
he being a popular character.</p>
</div>

<p>In this code the transition from the old to the new method is well
seen, for each signal has, besides a signal number for use after the
new method, a flag and position for use after the old, e.g.:</p>

<p>"Engage the enemy" could be signalled as No. 224 or by means
of a red flag at the fore topmast head.</p>

<p>"Prepare for battle" by the same flag at the fore topmast shrouds,
or as No. 226.</p>

<p>"Come to closer engagement" by a red and white flag (two horizontal
stripes) at the main topmast head, or as No. 171.</p>

<p>A special signal was provided to denote that the numerary signals
were going to be used for practice, when every ship was to note down
the significations. Kempenfelt improved upon Howe in that he did
not separate out the "Private ship" signals, but included all in one
series of more than 400 numbers. The flags for signalling by the old
method were mostly the same as those already in use. His "table"
for the new method was of 10 squares a side, as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="no-indent"><span class="pad05">1. Union.</span><br />
<span class="pad05">2. Yellow.</span><br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
    <span class="pad05">3. Blue and yellow, chequered.</span><br />
<span class="pad05">4. Red pierced with white.</span><br />
<span class="pad05">5. White cross on red ground.</span><br />
<span class="pad05">6. Blue cross on yellow ground.</span><br />
<span class="pad05">7. Red and white, quarterly.</span><br />
<span class="pad05">8. White and red in two vertical stripes.</span><br />
<span class="pad05">9. Yellow and blue in two vertical stripes.</span><br />
10. Red and white in four horizontal stripes.<br />
<span class="pad2">With pendants for 100, 200, 300, 400, and 500.</span></p>
</div>

<p>Further development of this code ceased in 1782 on Kempenfelt's
tragic end in the 'Royal George.'</p>

<div class="caption">PLATE XIII &mdash; Numerary Signal Flags, (1790-1810)</div>
</div>

<p class="p2" />
<p>From 1783 to 1788 Howe held office as First Lord of the Admiralty,
and seems to have devoted part of his time to the improvement
of the tactics of the Fighting Instructions and of their accompanying
signals. He elaborated a new signal book, which he introduced
into the navy on taking command of the Channel fleet. In
this new book he abandoned the "tabular" method so far as the bulk
of the signals&mdash;the Admiral's signals&mdash;were concerned, employing
instead the simple numerary method, and for these numerals he
chose the flags that were afterwards, in their transposed meanings,
used at Trafalgar. For this reason, and because it was the code used
on the "glorious First of June," and at Camperdown, and was the
basis of those used at St Vincent, the Nile, Copenhagen, and Trafalgar,
it is important to consider it in some detail.</p>

<p>This second numerary code of Howe, the <cite>Signal Book for the
Ships of War</cite> of 1790, is a quarto<a name="FNanchor_384" id="FNanchor_384"></a><a href="#Footnote_384" class="fnanchor">[384]</a> volume of 85 pages.</p>

<p>After three pages of explanatory instructions relative to the
method of making the signals, distinctness, destruction of signal
books in danger of falling into the hands of the enemy, etc., follow
two pages relative to the triangular distinguishing flags of squadrons.
We then come to the Admiral's signals&mdash;nearly 200 in number, commencing
at 10. These were, as already stated, in the "simple numerary"
system invented by La Bourdonnais, in which each signal
number is represented by the numeral flags corresponding to the
figures composing it.</p>

<p>The numeral flags, five of which&mdash;Nos. 2, 3, 4, 6, and 7&mdash;are new
to us, are shown in the accompanying plate. Each of these numeral
flags had, however, another signification when hoisted singly, as
follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="no-indent">1. Enemy in sight.<br />
2. Form in order of sailing by divisions.<br />
3. Form established order of sailing.<br />
4. Take and keep stations.<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>5. Engage the enemy.<br />
6. Signal not understood.<br />
7. To chase.<br />
8. To anchor.<br />
9. Leave off chase.<br />
0. Negative answer.</p>
</div>

<p>In addition to these, the following flags were to be used:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="pp negidt1">White cross on red ground.&mdash;Affirmative answer.</p>
<p class="pp negidt1">White with red border.&mdash;Annul.</p>
<p class="pp negidt1">Union.&mdash;To call officers.</p>
<p class="pp negidt1">Blue and yellow chequered.&mdash;Rendezvous.</p>
<p class="pp negidt1">Yellow.&mdash;To distinguish signals made to the fireships.</p>
<p class="pp negidt1">White with red border and pierced with blue.&mdash;Transpose the numeral flags.</p>
<p class="pp negidt1">Red and white, yellow and blue, and their inversions.&mdash;For the four quarters of the compass.</p>
<p class="pp negidt1">Blue cornet<a name="FNanchor_385" id="FNanchor_385"></a><a href="#Footnote_385" class="fnanchor">[385]</a>.
    &mdash;First signal to be carried out in the manner denoted by the remainder.</p>
<p class="pp negidt1">Red and white striped.&mdash;Substitute. To repeat the flag next above it.</p>
<p class="pp negidt1">Blue and white striped.&mdash;Preparative.</p>
<p class="pp negidt1">White flag:&mdash;</p>
<p class="pp negidt1"><span class="pad1">(1) Truce.</span></p>
<p class="pp negidt1"><span class="pad1">(2) Open secret instructions.</span></p>
<p class="pp negidt1"><span class="pad1">(3) Signal made herewith is to take effect after the close of day.</span></p>
</div>

<p>To illustrate the use of the two latter flags we may take Nelson's
signal at Trafalgar, "Prepare to anchor after the close of day."</p>

<p>This signal consisted of four flags in one hoist:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="no-indent">Preparative.<br />
No. 6 }<br />
No. 3 } Anchor as soon as convenient.<br />
White flag.</p>
</div>

<p>When a "Preparative" flag was hoisted with a signal it denoted
that the order was not to be immediately obeyed<a name="FNanchor_386" id="FNanchor_386"></a><a href="#Footnote_386" class="fnanchor">[386]</a>. If hauled down
together with the signal, preparation was to be made to obey the
latter directly the Admiral hoisted it again. If hauled down and the
signal left flying, the latter was then to be carried into execution.
Nelson had intended to hoist the signal to anchor (63) as soon as the
fighting was over, with a view to securing his battered ships and their
prizes against the bad weather he saw coming on, but Collingwood
could not carry out the intention.</p>

<p>The white flag had, in the Admiralty copy of the 1790 book, four
meanings. Alone, in battle, it denoted truce; hoisted at the fore topmast
head it could be used to call in distant ships; when hoisted with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>other flags it signified that the signal denoted by them was not to
be carried into effect until the day closed; and, finally, it denoted an
order to open secret instructions. In the Signal Book of 1793 the two
latter significations were denoted by a black and white flag, the former
when black was uppermost and the latter when white was uppermost.
In 1805 the white flag had the first and third of these meanings,
besides denoting numeral 8.</p>

<p>The Admiral's flags and signals of Howe's second code, as used
on 1st June, 1794, are reproduced in vol. 1 of <cite>Logs of the Great Sea
Fights</cite> (Navy Records Society).</p>

<p>These Admiral's, or "Numeral signals," as they are called by
Howe in contradistinction to his tabular "Signals by private ships,"
are grouped under various headings, beginning with "Battle," "Bear-up,"
"Bring-to," and going on to "Enemy," "Engage," "Line,"
"Order," "Sail," "Tack," etc.</p>

<p>We then have certain subsidiary pendant signals, of which the
most important are: a chequered blue and yellow pendant to denote
that accompanying numeral flags represented figures only, and a
quartered red and white pendant to serve the purpose of a note of
interrogation.</p>

<p>Now follow nine signals made with sails and guns, a quaint survival
that disappears in 1799 [Except No. 1. This was No. 174 of the
'99 Code, but could be made by the fore topsail if desired.] The
following are their purports:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>1. "To prepare for sailing," denoted by loosing the fore topsail, just
as in Rooke's Instructions of 1703. 2. Every one to repair to his respective
ship. 3. Recalling ships. 4. Unmoor. 5. Weigh. 6. Moor (denoted by
"Main topsail loose in top"). 8. Cut or slip. 9. Fast on shoal.</p>
</div>

<p>We next have 14 signals for calling officers to take orders, made
with the Union flag in different positions; a few signals to fireships,
made with the yellow flag; 20 fog signals made with guns; and then
the tabular signals for private ships. The "table" provided for these
shows a slight variation on the usual form. It is not quite square,
being 8 wide and 9 deep, as the first flag space on the left side is
blank, so that the first row 1 to 8 is made by single flags. The flags
used are:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="no-indent">1. Red.<br />
2. Blue.<br />
3. White over red, two horizontal stripes.<br />
4. The same inverted.<br />
5. Blue over yellow, two horizontal stripes.<br />
6. The same inverted.<br />
7. Union.<br />
8. Blue, white, red, horizontally.</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span></p>

<p>Stars are placed in the four squares whose flags would be one of
the invertible flags over its own inversion, probably because there
was only one flag supplied of each design, and the other squares
are numbered 1 to 68. Sixty-one signals are given. We then have
half a dozen signals with Jacks, Pendants, and Wefts, Signals for
each point of the compass, ending with 11 pages of Night signals.</p>

<p>Perhaps the best testimony of the value of this book is given in
the letter from Nelson to Howe in acknowledgment of his congratulations
on the victory of the Nile:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="right">8th January 1799. &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>

<p>It was only this moment that I had the invaluable approbation of the
great, the immortal Earl Howe, an honour the most flattering a Sea-Officer
could receive, as it comes from the first and greatest Sea-Officer the world
has ever produced. I had the happiness to command a Band of Brothers;
therefore night was to my advantage. Each knew his duty, and I was sure
each would feel for a French ship. By attacking the enemy's van and centre,
the wind blowing directly along their Line, I was enabled to throw what
force I pleased on a few Ships. This plan my friends conceived by the
signals (for which we are principally if not entirely indebted to your Lordship)
and we always kept a superior force to the enemy<a name="FNanchor_387" id="FNanchor_387"></a><a href="#Footnote_387" class="fnanchor">[387]</a>.</p>
</div>

<p>Meanwhile, John McArthur, a purser in the navy, who had
during the war of American Independence been frequently stationed
to observe signals in the fleet and had therefore practical experience
of the delays, difficulties and misunderstandings that occurred with
the older methods of signalling by flags in particular positions, had
been for many years at work on a new code which he submitted to
the Admiralty in 1790. The basis of this plan was the old tabular
system with two flags hoisted together or separately at the most conspicuous
parts of the ship. The code contained upwards of 550
signals, with provision for an indefinite increase, and incorporated
an ingenious device for continuously altering the numerical value of
the flags. It was an advance upon any of the codes hitherto in use,
but "some scruples of delicacy intervened in the adoption of any
new plan of signals which would supersede that of Earl Howe's
numerary code," and it was not adopted. Nevertheless, it attracted
the attention of Hood, then the Senior Sea Lord, and on his appointment
to command the Russian armament in 1791 he made McArthur
his secretary. McArthur then turned his attention to re-arranging
Howe's signals "by simplifying the form with Indices for facilitating
their being made and understood, and engrafting in the body and
instructions many new ideas and instructions of his own." Howe
approved of the alterations, and the revised code was then printed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
and issued to Hood's fleet. This "new arrangement" was introduced
by Hood in 1793 into the Mediterranean and continued to be used
there until 1799. It was the signal book in use at the Battles of St Vincent
and the Nile. In it the values of Howe's numeral flags, as shown
in Col. 1 of <a href="#PLATE_XIII">Plate XIII</a>, were transposed as follows: 1 became 4; 2, 9;
3, 7; 4, 2; 5, 6; 6, 0; 7, 8; 8, 5; 9, 3; and 0, 1. The tabular flags
were also transposed, 1 becoming 8; 2, 7; 3, 5; 5, 3; 6, 2; 7, 1; 8, 6;
while 4 remained of the same value.</p>

</div><div>

<h4><a name="Chapter_VId" id="Chapter_VId"></a><a href="#CONTENTS">(iv) THE VOCABULARY SIGNAL BOOK</a></h4>

<p>With the compilation, in 1790, of Howe's second signal book, we
have the end of that system, or want of system, which is especially
noticeable during the American War of Independence, under which
the signals used in each fleet or squadron varied with the idiosyncrasies
of each individual commander-in-chief. Henceforth, although
it was usual for the admiral commanding each fleet to add a few of
his own devising, the bulk of the signals were, so to speak, stereotyped
in form, and were in general use throughout the British navy.</p>

<p>In 1799 the <cite>Signal Book for the Ships of War</cite> was increased in
size to 167 pages by the addition of an index to the signals and the
inclusion of the printed instructions. The "Private ship" signals were
placed at the end of the "Admiral's signals" and numbered consecutively
after them, so that the "tabular" flags disappear, and all signals
are henceforth made by the simple numerary code, the total number
being increased from about 260 to 340.</p>

<p>It will be seen from the plate of numeral flags that Howe's
numerals were continued in the 1799 book with only two slight modifications:
No. 1, instead of being a plain red flag, became yellow, red,
yellow, in three equal horizontal stripes, and the substitute became
plain white. But his arrangement was simplified. The half black and
white flags were done away with as unnecessary, since their meanings
could equally well be expressed by those remaining.</p>

<p>In addition to the signal book, each commander-in-chief compiled
for his own fleet a tabular "pendant board," on which two
pendants were assigned to the name of each ship of his fleet. By this
means he was enabled to address any of the signals to a particular
ship, without making the command general to the whole squadron.
For example, Nelson, at Trafalgar, before making general his favourite
signal, "Engage the enemy more closely," addressed it particularly
to the 'Africa,' which, having become separated over night, found
herself at a distance from the two columns, and, just before the commencement
of the action, was sailing near to the enemy's van, on an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
opposite and parallel course. This he did by hoisting flags Nos. 1
and 6, together with the pendants appropriated to the 'Africa's'
name on the "pendant board."</p>

<p>But a code for signalling or other purposes is like a language; if
the language is what we call "dead," i.e. if words have ceased to be
added to it, it is of little use for expressing every-day needs. Similarly,
if the navy is not stagnating, continual amplification of tactics or of
every-day details necessitates an increase in the range of conversation
between the Admiral and his fleet. Although at the time of the battle
of Trafalgar the signal book was only six years old, it had already had
its range of signals increased by upwards of 80 additions, made in
manuscript, on such varied matters as:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="pp">412. "The ships or vessels chased have separated on different courses."</p>
<p class="pp">280. "Send for fresh beef immediately."</p>
<p class="pp">291. "Engage the enemy as close as possible."</p>
</div>

<p>This last is the third signal provided for close engagement, the
others being "Engage the enemy more closely," expressed either by
No. 16 (the signal Nelson favoured), or by the red pendant over the
quarter-red and white flag.</p>

<p>The need for a more flexible method of communication than that
of set sentences had long been felt. Rodney and Howe had both found
it impossible, in face of the enemy, to make their instructions clear to
their captains, and even without this distraction, in bad weather,
when ships could not get near enough for the voice to carry from one
to another even with the assistance of the speaking trumpet, or when
the roar of the gale rendered speech of no avail except within a range
of a very few feet, while the launching of a boat was out of the
question, much inconvenience had often been felt. Even when verbal
communication was possible, much time was lost in closing near
enough to make it.</p>

<p>The steps to remedy this impediment&mdash;to make, as it were, the
flag-language more civilised, so that it might express refinements of
thought in one direction and little every-day wants in another, to
increase, that is, its scope of expression from that of a child to that of
a grown man&mdash;were first taken by Sir Home Popham.</p>

<p>It may be that in this matter, as in so many other inventions, the
first to make some practical use of an idea got that idea at second
hand<a name="FNanchor_388" id="FNanchor_388"></a><a href="#Footnote_388" class="fnanchor">[388]</a>. However this may be in Popham's case, it is clear that the
labour of perfecting the invention and what is perhaps equally important,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
of persuading others that it was really worth a trial, was
undertaken by Popham alone. For twelve years the books which he
produced were privately printed by him, and from the free-handed
way in which he gave them to his brother officers when urging them
to try this code, it is probable that he carried out his propaganda at
some pecuniary expense to himself. The idea that dominated it was
to provide parts of speech and let the users make their own sentences
whenever those in the signal book did not suffice. It was the step
from a "Traveller's Manual of Conversation" to a dictionary of the
language.</p>

<p>Popham tells us that his <cite>Telegraphic Signals, or Marine Vocabulary</cite>
("telegraphic" being, of course, used thirty years before the invention
of the electric telegraph, in its primary sense of writing at a
distance) was originally compiled in 1800, to facilitate the conveyance
of messages from Popham's ship, the 'Romney,' off Copenhagen,
to Admiral Dickson, off Elsinore, when that officer, with a
squadron of ships, was giving additional weight to the British
Ministers' arguments with the Danish Court. "Its utility was in that
instance so obvious and so generally allowed by the Captains of the
North Sea Squadron that Sir Home Popham conceived it might be
brought into more extensive practice."</p>

<p>The first edition of this code consisted of nearly 1000 words chosen
by Popham from the dictionary as most useful for naval purposes. In
1803 a second part, consisting of nearly 1000 less useful words, and
a third part, consisting of nearly 1000 "sentences most applicable to
military or general conversation" were added. To prevent the signal
numbers from becoming unduly high, derivations were grouped with
their root-word, e.g. expedite, expedited, expediting, expedition, and
expeditious were each expressed by No. 270, it being left for the receiver
to determine the exact word by the context. Further, "In verbs, the
number, person, tense and mood" had to "be applied to the sense of
the sentence." When the exact word was not in the vocabulary, the one
most nearly synonymous was to be adopted, but "should it be of
any consequence to use a word not in the vocabulary," it could be
spelt by the numerical alphabet, which was known by the numbers
1 to 25. It may be noted, as the solution of the conundrum that has
puzzled many in spelling out "duty" in Nelson's celebrated signal
that in this alphabet, not only are I and J treated as one letter, but
V precedes U.</p>

<p>Thus, in the preparation for that signal, when Pasco told Nelson
that "confides" was not in the vocabulary, he suggested the "one
nearest synonymous," namely, "expects," as this latter could be
expressed by three flags in one hoist, while "confides" required 11<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
flags in eight hoists. "Duty," however, had to be spelt<a name="FNanchor_389" id="FNanchor_389"></a><a href="#Footnote_389" class="fnanchor">[389]</a>. The sentiment
of the signal had been sufficiently spoilt by the substitution of
"expects" for "confides"; the further substitution of "best" or
"utmost" would have hopelessly ruined it.</p>

<p>When the words of the message had been chosen from the vocabulary
and their corresponding numbers written down for the signalman's
guidance, it remained to translate them into flags. To do this
required nine flags to represent the figures 1 to 9, and one flag to
represent the cipher. It was convenient to add one or two substitute
flags to say "ditto," in case not more than one flag of each numeral
was available, with two flags for "yes" and "no."</p>

<p>Popham found all these flags already provided in the 1799 <cite>Signal
Book for the Ships of War</cite>, but the thousands he expressed thus:
numbers between 1000 and 2000 by a ball or pendant placed above
the "hoist," or group of three flags representing the hundreds, tens,
and units; and numbers above 2000 by a similar ball or pendant
placed below the "hoist." This was done to avoid unduly increasing
the "substitute" flags, as one set of numeral flags was often all that
was available, and for the same reason such numbers as 333, 888,
2222 were omitted from the code.</p>

<p>All that was now wanted was a flag to denote whether the signal
hoisted was to be deciphered by the Signal Book or by the Vocabulary
Code. For this purpose Popham designed a flag divided diagonally
into white and red to be used as a "preparative" or "telegraph" flag,
with all signals made in his code. This was hoisted before the message
started, and hauled down when it finished.</p>

<p>Such were the signal books in use at Trafalgar, and in the hands
of a man like Nelson, who did not keep his tactical ideas to himself,
but discussed them freely with his captains during the months of
watching and preparation, they proved amply sufficient for the purpose.</p>

<p>But suppose the books were captured by the enemy; how then?
In such an event, which all captains were told to guard against by
throwing the books overboard if there was any probability of their
ship being captured, the most effective precaution was to change the
whole of the signal numbers, both in the general signals and in the
vocabulary, but this was a heavy task.</p>

<p>A less effective method was to transpose all the flags. It was less
effective since, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ex hypothesi</i>, the enemy had the signal books, they had
therefore only to note the colours of the flags which preceded some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
easily recognised manoeuvre, such as "Make more sail," "Bear up
and sail large," to discover what flags were now being used to indicate
the signal numbers which they saw against that signal. A little patience
and ingenuity would then supply the key to the changes in the flags,
whereas if all the signal numbers were irregularly transposed, each
signal would have to be re-constituted separately by the enemy.</p>

<p>About fifteen months before Trafalgar the 12-gun schooner,
'Redbridge,' commanded by a Lieut. Lemprière, who, to judge by
Nelson's remarks about him, was not particularly efficient, was captured
by some French frigates off Toulon. Such a small ship, commanded
by an officer of such subordinate rank, was not allowed the
confidential signal books, but Lemprière had, in common with many
other junior officers, obtained a surreptitious copy for himself&mdash;one
of those little manuscript and hand-painted signal books one sees in
museums, or occasionally picks up in second-hand book shops.</p>

<p>This book Lieut. Lemprière had neglected to throw overboard,
and when, later on, one of Nelson's scouts, looking into Toulon harbour
to see if the French were getting on comfortably, found the
captured 'Redbridge' just outside, the latter made the signal for the
scout ship to anchor; but fortunately the officer in command was a
little sharper than the 'Redbridge's' late commander had been, and
the net was spread in vain.</p>

<p>Directly Nelson learned this he changed the flags and reported
the matter to the Admiralty. On the 4th November, the Admiralty,
despite the objection of Lord Keith that a change of signal numbers
would be better, issued a circular letter to all commanders-in-chief
telling them to alter their numeral flags in accordance with a painted
copy enclosed with the letter. These are the flags shown in the third
column of the plate. Further, as their Lordships had reason to apprehend
that Lieut. Lemprière was not the only officer under commander's
rank who had obtained a copy of the signal book, the strictest
injunctions were to be given that such improper proceedings were not
to take place in future, and existing irregular copies were to be impounded.</p>

<p>The flags in use in the Mediterranean were changed in numerical
value in accordance with the Admiralty order on the 16th January,
1804, and these new numeral flags were the ones used at Trafalgar,
and, in fact, until the end of 1810<a name="FNanchor_390" id="FNanchor_390"></a><a href="#Footnote_390" class="fnanchor">[390]</a>.</p>

<p>We have seen that Howe's second code, first in its original form,
next as re-arranged by McArthur, and finally as simplified and expanded
for the 1799 Signal Book, in each case with practically the
same numeral flags, sufficed, when supplemented by Popham's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
Vocabulary, for the navy's needs throughout the most sustained and
strenuous struggle that until the recent war had ever fallen to its lot<a name="FNanchor_391" id="FNanchor_391"></a><a href="#Footnote_391" class="fnanchor">[391]</a>.</p>

<p>Towards the close of this period, however, Popham, who seems
to have devoted all the time not required for his professional duties,
or for defence against the attacks made upon him, to the improvement
of his code<a name="FNanchor_392" id="FNanchor_392"></a><a href="#Footnote_392" class="fnanchor">[392]</a>, brought out a greatly enlarged and improved vocabulary,
which is best described in his own words:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The present edition is wholly new cast and composed; very considerably
enlarged by additional materials; and, as I trust, improved by a distribution
of those materials which was intended to increase the facility of
reference.</p>

<p>It consists of nearly 6,000 primitive words, exclusive of the inflexions
of verbs, &amp;c., making in all upwards of 30,000 real words; the sentences
have also been extended to about 6,000, with 1,500 syllables, a Geographical
Table, a Table of Technical Terms, a Table of Stores and Provisions, and
a Spare Table for Local Significations.</p>
</div>

<p>With so large a number of signals the limitation in the number
of flags that can be conveniently hoisted at a time made itself at once
felt, and Popham found himself compelled to abandon the "simple
numerary" method. Taking the limit of convenience at three flags,
the ten numeral flags of the Admiralty Signal Book would suffice for
only 999 signals. Popham, therefore, after calculating the number of
combinations available with various sets of flags, chose 23. These,
which were mostly of his own design, he denoted by the numbers
1 to 9 and the letters A to O. With these 23 flags the number of
available combinations is as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" summary="Combinations with 23 flags">
<tr><td align="left">Singly</td><td></td><td align="right">23</td></tr>
<tr><td align="left">Two at a time</td><td></td><td align="right">506</td></tr>
<tr><td align="left">Three at a time</td><td></td><td align="right">10,626</td></tr>
<tr><td align="left"></td><td></td><td align="right">&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</td></tr>
<tr><td align="left"></td><td align="left">Total &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</td><td align="right">11,155</td></tr>
</table></div>

<p>So that upwards of 11,000 signals could be made using no more than
three flags in one hoist.</p>

<p>Hoisting four flags at a time, the number of possible signals with
23 flags is increased by 212,520, making 223,675 in all, sufficient for
the most exhaustive vocabulary. If this code had been invented seven
years earlier, Nelson could have made his signal in precisely his own
words, the first three of which would have been as follows: England,
69B; confides, 5I3; that, B67. Curiously enough, Popham, in 1812,
seems to have preferred "confides" to "expects," for the former was
one of "most needed" words and could be made by three flags,
whereas "expects" was No. 6138 and required four.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span></p>

<p>In demonstrating the extensive use to which his code could be
put, Popham gives one or two amusing illustrations, apparently in
all seriousness. Thus:</p>

<div class="left-a">
<table border="0" cellpadding="1" cellspacing="0" summary="Example of Popham code">
<tr><td align="left">FA1</td><td align="left">Have you an idea</td></tr>
<tr><td align="left">G647&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</td><td align="left">a change of ministers is about to take place</td></tr>

<tr><td align="left">85F</td><td align="left">to</td></tr>
<tr><td align="left">C87</td><td align="left">a Lord of the Admiralty</td></tr>
</table></div>

<p>This vocabulary, published in 1812, was such an evident improvement
that it was issued to the fleet in 1813.</p>

<p>In 1816 it was revised by Popham and re-issued by the Admiralty
as an official Vocabulary Signal Book. Eleven years later the signal
books were again revised and re-cast in three volumes:&mdash;</p>

<p>1. The General Signal Book, containing evolutionary and battle
signals, to which the numeral flags were henceforth appropriated.</p>

<p>2. The Vocabulary Signal Book, containing words and general
sentences, to which were appropriated the alphabetical flags, now
increased to 21 by the addition of P, Q, R, S, T, V, and Y.</p>

<p>3. Night and fog signals.</p>

<p>In 1882, W was substituted for V and slight alterations were made
in some of the flags, and in 1889, when the signal books underwent
a more extensive revision, the alphabetical series was completed by
the inclusion of all the letters, and a series of numeral pendants was
added. The flags thus finally established in 1889 remain in use to this
day. It may be observed that they contain a number of survivals from
Howe's Code of 1790, four indeed with their original significance.
They are as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>These pendants are all of a different shape from those employed
in the alphabetical series, being more narrow and elongated, and cut
off square at the end, whereas the former are almost equilateral and

<p>With these we have probably reached the final development of
form so far as flag signals are concerned, for wireless has taken the
place of visual signalling to such an extent that it is not likely that
circumstances can now arise that will necessitate any radical recasting
of the flag signal system.</p>

<h4><a name="Chapter_VIe" id="Chapter_VIe"></a><a href="#CONTENTS">(v) COMMERCIAL CODES</a></h4>

<p>Some elementary flag signals, notably that for a pilot, were in use
among merchantmen at least as early as the <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;original text: fifthteenth">fifteenth</ins> century, but
the first attempt to supply a code of signals suitable for merchant
ships appears to have been that made by Sir Home Popham in 1804,
when, at the request of the East India Company, he compiled a book
of "Commercial and Military Signals" for the use of the ships in
their service. In this book the "military" element preponderates, as
might be expected from the circumstances of the time at which it
was drawn up. The signals relate almost exclusively to the fighting
and manoeuvring of ships sailing in convoy. After the peace, in 1817,
Captain Frederick Marryat drew up what may be regarded as the
precurser of modern commercial codes. It was in six parts, each in
the simple numerary system, with a distinguishing flag to indicate
the part to which the signal related. The parts were as follows:
1. Names of men-of-war. 2. Names of merchantmen. 3. Ports, headlands,
etc. 4. Sentences on various subjects. 5 and 6. A vocabulary
adapted from Popham. This signal book went through ten editions
before the author's death in 1848.</p>

<p>In 1855, owing to the enormous increase in communication by
sea, and the adoption of an official number for every merchant ship
imposed by the Merchant Shipping Act of 1854, the need for a much<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
more ample code had become urgent, and the Board of Trade appointed
a Committee to draw up a new one. This committee reported
that an efficient code "ought to provide for not less than 20,000
distinct signals and should, besides, be capable of designating not
less than 50,000 ships, with power of extension if required." They
further stated that "a signal should not consist of more than four
flags or symbols at one hoist," and pointed out that under this condition
the ten numerals without repeaters would make only 5860
signals, or 9999 signals with three repeaters. They therefore abandoned
the numeral system and chose 18 flags which, by using two,
three, or four flags together, allowed of 78,642 permutations. These
18 flags, which embodied most of those already in use in Marryat's
Code unchanged, or with slight alteration, were designated by the
letters of the alphabet except a, e, i, o, u, x, y, z, the vowels being
omitted because "by introducing them every objectionable word composed
of four letters or less, not only in our own but in foreign
languages, would appear in the code in the course of the permutation
of the letters of the alphabet."</p>

<p>The flags adopted were as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="pp">B &nbsp;&nbsp; red burgee (flag with swallow-tailed fly)</p>
<p class="pp">C &nbsp;&nbsp; pendant white with red ball</p>
<p class="pp">D &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;blue with white ball</p>
<p class="pp">F &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;" &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;red</p>
<p class="pp">G &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;divided vertically yellow and blue</p>
<p class="pp">H &nbsp;&nbsp; flag divided vertically white and red</p>
<p class="pp">J &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;" &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;" &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;horizontally blue, white, blue</p>
<p class="pp">K &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; " &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;" &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;vertically yellow and blue</p>

<p class="pp">M &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"&nbsp; &nbsp; blue with white saltire</p>
<p class="pp">N &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"&nbsp; &nbsp; chequered blue and white</p>
<p class="pp">P &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"&nbsp; &nbsp; blue pierced with white square (the blue Peter)</p>
<p class="pp">Q &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"&nbsp; &nbsp; yellow</p>
<p class="pp">R &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"&nbsp; &nbsp; red with yellow cross</p>
<p class="pp">S &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"&nbsp; &nbsp; white pierced with blue square</p>
<p class="pp">T &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"&nbsp; &nbsp; divided vertically red, white, blue</p>
<p class="pp">V &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"&nbsp; &nbsp; white with red saltire</p>
<p class="pp">W&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"&nbsp; &nbsp; blue bordered white pierced with red square,</p>
</div>

<p class="no-indent">and an "Answering Signal" or Code Pendant divided vertically red
and white in five stripes. In 1857 this "Commercial Code of Signals
for use of all Nations" was issued by the Board of Trade, and it
sufficed for the needs of the next thirty years, the name being changed
to International Code about 1880. At the end of that period the Board
of Trade appointed a Committee to bring it up to date and to consider
whether a system of night signals should be added to it. In
1899 this Committee submitted a revision of the Code "which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
differed from that then current only in the omission of certain signals
which had become obsolete and the substitution of certain other
signals for which modern developments had created a demand." The
criticisms of the foreign maritime powers upon this book led, however,
to a complete revision and recasting of the old code for reasons
which the Committee summarise in their final report<a name="FNanchor_394" id="FNanchor_394"></a><a href="#Footnote_394" class="fnanchor">[394]</a> in 1896 in the
following words:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Since the old Code of signals was first issued there has been a very
considerable increase in the average speed of vessels belonging to the
Mercantile Marine, owing both to the larger percentage of steamers as
compared with sailing vessels and to the greater speed to which steamers
now attain. Vessels consequently remain within signalling distance of one
another and of signal stations for a much shorter time than was the case
40 years ago, and it is necessary that an efficient Code of signals should
provide the means of rapid communication. In a Code, such as the International
Code, in which signals are made chiefly by means of flags, rapidity
of communication can best be secured by reducing to a minimum the
number of flags required to make the signals, since every additional flag
in a hoist involves delay in bending on the flags on the part of the person
making the signals and delay in making out the flags on the part of the
person taking in the signals, and to enable this to be done without the
number of signals in the Code being reduced, it was necessary to provide
an increased number of two or three flag signals by adding additional
flags to the Code.</p>

<p>The number of signals which can be made by permutations of 18 flags,
no flag being used more than once in the same hoist, is as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>The following is the number of signals which can be made by means of
the 26 flags which we have adopted, no flag being used more than once in
the same hoist:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Moreover, by using the Code pennant over and under one or two flags
of the Code, the following additional signals made by not more than three
flags are obtainable:&mdash;</p>
</div>

<div class="left-a">

<div class="blockquot">

<p>It will therefore be seen that by the adoption of the eight additional
flags, many of the more important signals which have at present to be made
by three-flag hoists can be converted into two-flag signals, and that all the
four-flag signals (excluding those representing the names of places and
of ships) in the old Code can be made by three-flag signals, while between
3,000 and 4,000 new signals to be made by hoists of not more than three
flags can be added.</p>

<p>The abolition of all four-flag hoists for general signals will very greatly
increase the <em>Rapidity</em> with which communication can be held by means of
the International Code of Signals.</p>

<p>It will also tend to secure another essential in efficient signalling, viz.,
<em>Accuracy</em>, for every flag added to a hoist affords an extra risk of mistake,
both in bending on a wrong flag and in reading off the flags in the hoist
incorrectly.</p>

<p>In addition to the gain of rapidity and accuracy of signalling, the
inclusion of the eight new flags has, as we have already stated, afforded
the means of providing a large number of signals which do not appear in
the current Code, and we have availed ourselves of this possibility to the
extent of adding some 4,000 new signals.</p>

<p>Moreover, the fact that under the proposed scheme there is a flag to
represent every letter of the alphabet has enabled us to arrange for a
system of spelling proper names and words not appearing in the Signal
Book, which we regard as less cumbersome than the Alphabetical Spelling
Table which is at present in force.</p>

<p>These advantages appear to us to be so important that we have not
hesitated to increase the number of flags to be used, although the step
involved the abandonment of the Code suggested by us in 1889 and the
preparation of an entirely new Signal Book.</p>
</div>

<p>The letters omitted from the alphabet in 1855 were now added,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
the objection which had led to their omission on the former occasion
being regarded as a "sentimental rather than practical objection,"
though the Committee took care to eliminate objectionable words as
far as practicable.</p>

<p>The flags now added were:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="pp">A &nbsp;&nbsp; Burgee divided vertically white and blue</p>
<p class="pp">E &nbsp;&nbsp; Pendant &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;" &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;" &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; red, white, blue</p>
<p class="pp">I &nbsp;&nbsp; Flag yellow with blue ball</p>
<p class="pp">O &nbsp; Flag divided diagonally yellow and red</p>
<p class="pp">U &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;" &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;" &nbsp; &nbsp; quarterly red and white</p>
<p class="pp">X &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;" &nbsp; &nbsp;white with blue cross</p>
<p class="pp">Y &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;" &nbsp; &nbsp;striped diagonally yellow and red in ten stripes</p>
<p class="pp">Z &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;" &nbsp; &nbsp;divided diagonally in 4 triangular parts, yellow, blue, red, and black.</p>
</div>

<p>At the same time the F and L flags were slightly altered.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>We have altered the flag F from a red pennant with a white ball on it
to a red pennant with a white cross, as the flag at present in use is liable
to be mistaken for Flag D (blue pennant with a white ball on it), and we
have altered flag L from a flag of yellow and blue quarterly (the blue
squares being at the top left-hand and bottom right-hand corners) to a
flag of yellow and black quarterly, the black squares being at the top right-hand
and bottom left-hand corners. Our chief reason for making this
alteration is that in a calm it is difficult to distinguish the present flag L
from flag K.</p>
</div>

<p>Certain of the above flags are used singly with special significations,
viz. A by H.M. ships on full speed trial, B to signify that
explosives are being landed or discharged, C as affirmative, D as
negative, P to denote that the ship is about to sail and S as signal for
a pilot, while L is used in the United Kingdom to indicate infection
from cholera, Yellow fever or plague, and Q is generally used aboard
to denote liability to quarantine.</p>

<p>Signals made with two flags are urgent and important. Of the
three-flag signals those from ABC to AST relate to the compass;
from ASU to AVJ to money; from AVK to BCN to weights and
measures; BCO to BOZ to decimals and fractions; from BEA to
CWT to auxiliary verbs and phrases; while the general vocabulary
occupies the permutations from CXA to ZNV. The Code flag over
two flags serves for Latitude and Longitude, Divisions of time, and
the Barometer and Thermometer, and the Code flag under two flags
from UA to ZY provides a numeral table. The geographical names of
places are signalled by four flags from ABCD to BFAU, while the
permutations from CBDF to CZYX are used for an alphabetical
spelling table. This completes the flag signals of the Code, but it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
contains in addition a number of Distant Signals, Semaphore Signals
and Morse Code Signals.</p>

<p>Combinations from GQBC onwards are used for the names of
ships, which will be found in separate publications.</p>

<p>This new Code was published in 1899 and brought into force on
1st January, 1901, the old Code being used concurrently with it until
the 31st December of that year. It has now reached the seventeenth
edition, and a complete revision of it, which will probably entail the
alteration of many of the flags, is occupying the attention of an International
Commission, but it will be several years before this is brought
into use.</p>

<p>In making a signal, a ship first hoists her ensign with the code
flag under it, and if necessary the distinguishing signal of the vessel
or station with which she desires to communicate. On seeing this
signal the ship (or station) addressed then hoists the "Answering
Pendant" (i.e. the Code flag) at the "Dip," that is, some little distance
below its position when hoisted "close up" to the block at the
masthead or yardarm through which the signal halliards are rove.
The first ship then hoists her own distinguishing signal, consisting
of the four letters appropriated to her name, and then proceeds with
the signal she wishes to make. When the first hoist is noted down and
translated in the ship receiving the signal, this ship hauls the answering
pendant "close up" to show that the signal is understood and keeps
it there until the signalling ship has hauled that hoist down; the
answering pendant is then again lowered to the "Dip" until the next
hoist is disposed of, and when the ship signalling has finished, she
hauls down her ensign to indicate that the message is at an end.</p>

<p>Among signals of distress by means of flags&mdash;which from their
nature are of international use and common to both men-of-war and
merchant ships&mdash;the earliest appears to have been made by tying
the ensign in a knot in the middle, or making a weft as it was called.
Another, which appears to have been in use in the seventeenth
century, was to invert the ensign; this, of course, could not be done
with those ensigns (such as the modern French) which are symmetrical
in design. The signal appears sometimes to have been given by placing
the ensign in an unusual position, such as at the main topmast-head or
in the shrouds. An instance in which the ensign was placed inverted
in the shrouds will be found on <a href="#Page_199">page 199</a>.</p>

 Shortly after 1756 the white balls disappear, and a white square takes their
place, the flag thus becoming what is now familiarly called the Blue Peter. By
Rodney's time this flag at the mainmast head had become the signal to recall
everyone to his ship, whence its present use to denote that the ship is about to sail.</p></div>

<h3><i>Ceremonial and other Usages</i></h3>

<p class="drop-cap2"><span class="smcap">The</span> student who has wandered along the by-paths of early military
and naval history may perhaps have been struck by the fact that
although he met not infrequently with instances of the devotion and
respect with which the soldier regarded his military ensigns he met
with no similar examples in naval affairs. He might at first be disposed
to attribute this to the fact that the histories he had read were not
the work of professed seamen, but upon reflexion he would more
probably be disposed to infer that, except in the ship of the Commander-in-Chief,
there was at sea nothing to correspond to the military
insignia. The examination into the early history of the flag which
we have endeavoured to carry out in the first chapter of this book
leads us to the conclusion that until the thirteenth century there was
no equivalent of the military ensign in use at sea, and the early history
of the salute at sea tends to confirm this view.</p>

<p>The Ordinance<a name="FNanchor_395" id="FNanchor_395"></a><a href="#Footnote_395" class="fnanchor">[395]</a> drawn up by King John in 1201, which required
all ships and vessels to strike and lower their sails at the command of
the King's ships, makes no mention of a flag, and although the striking
of the sails was perhaps primarily intended not so much as a mark of
respect as a practical means of ensuring that the ships in question
should render an effective submission to the will of the king's officers,
the omission is at any rate of some significance. An instructive commentary
upon the relative significance of the acts of striking sails or
flags is afforded by the account of the taking of two Spanish ships
by the 'Amity' of London in 1592<a name="FNanchor_396" id="FNanchor_396"></a><a href="#Footnote_396" class="fnanchor">[396]</a>. These merchantmen had fallen
in with each other off the south-west coast of Spain, and apparently
each side had determined to make prize of the other. The Spaniards
were displaying a flag with the arms of the King of Spain, which
caused the English to "judge them rather ships of warre then laden
with marchandise." After a long fight the English ship gained the
advantage,</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="no-indent">willing them to yeeld, or els we should sinke them: wherupon the one
would have yeelded, which was shot betweene winde and water; but the
other called him traiter. Unto whom we made answere, that if he would
not yeeld presently also, we would sinke him first. And thereupon he
understanding our determination, presently put out a white flag, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>yeelded, and yet refused to strike their own sailes, for that they were
sworne never to strike to any Englishmen.</p>
</div>

<p>Evidently the striking of the sails was an act of greater submission
than the display of the flag of truce, and its persistent survival until
the year 1806 as part of the ceremony required when the salute was
exacted by H.M. ships is a clear indication that it must have been
originally the most essential part of that ceremony. When Pennington
was given his instructions as Admiral of the Narrow Seas in May,
1631, he was told:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>If in this yo<sup>r</sup> imployment you shall chance to meete in the Narrowe
Seas anie ffleete belonging to anie forraine Prince or State you are to expect
that the Admirall and cheefe of them in acknowledgmt of his Ma<sup>ts</sup> Soveraignty
there shall strike their Top-sayle in passing by, or if they refuse
to do it you are to force them thereunto<a name="FNanchor_397" id="FNanchor_397"></a><a href="#Footnote_397" class="fnanchor">[397]</a>,</p>
</div>

<p class="no-indent">but no instruction was given him in regard to their flag, and the
Treaty made between Cromwell and the Dutch at the close of the
First Dutch War in 1654 required the latter not only to haul down
their flag when rendering the salute, but also to lower the topsail
(<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">vexillum suum e mali vertice detrahent et supremum velum demittent</i>).</p>

<p>After Trafalgar the British Naval Power stood at such a height
that it was felt that no loss of prestige could then arise from the
abandonment of the claim so tenaciously insisted on for many centuries,
and the instructions to naval officers to exact the salute were
quietly dropped out of the <cite>King's Regulations</cite> where they had, for
many years, appeared in the following terms:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>When any of His Majesty's Ships shall meet with any Ship or Ships
belonging to any Foreign Prince or State, within His Majesty's Seas,
(which extend to Cape <em>Finisterre</em>) it is expected that the said Foreign Ships
do strike their Topsail, and take in their Flag, in Acknowledgement of
His Majesty's Sovereignty in those Seas; and if any shall refuse or offer
to resist, it is enjoined to all Flag Officers and Commanders to use their
utmost Endeavours to compel them thereto, and not suffer any Dishonour
to be done to His Majesty. And if any of His Majesty's Subjects shall so
much forget their Duty, as to omit striking their Topsail in passing by
His Majesty's Ships, the Name of the Ship and Master, and from whence,
and whither bound, together with Affidavits of the Fact, are to be sent up
to the Secretary of the Admiralty, in order to their being proceeded against
in the Admiralty Court. And it is to be observed, That in His Majesty's
Seas, His Majesty's Ships are in no wise to strike to any; and that in other
Parts, no Ship of His Majesty's is to strike her Flag or Topsail to any
Foreigner, unless such Foreign Ship shall have first struck, or at the same
time strike her Flag or Top-sail to His Majesty's Ship.</p>
</div>

<p>An adequate presentment of the history of the salute at sea would
claim a volume to itself, and is indeed rather outside the scope of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
present work, but it may be remarked that in the sixteenth century
(and probably at an earlier date, though evidence of this is lacking)
the requirement of the salute&mdash;in itself a mere passing ceremony&mdash;was
expanded into a demand that no foreign ship or English merchantman
should fly any flag at all when in the presence of any of
H.M. ships of war. This point of view, as understood by the seamen
of the late Elizabethan and early Stuart period, is set forth in the
<cite>Observations</cite> of Sir Richard Hawkins published just after his death
in 1622:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>One thing the French suffered (upon what occasion or ground I know
not) that the English always carried their flag displayed: which in other
partes and Kingdomes is not permitted; at least in our seas, if a Stranger
Fleete meete with any of his Majesties ships, the forraigners are bound to
take in their flags, or his Majesties ships to force them to it though thereof
follow the breach of peace, or whatsoever discommodity. And whosoever
should not be jealous in this point, hee is not worthy to have the commaund
of a Cock-boat committed unto him: yea no stranger ought to open his
flag in any Port of England, where there is any Shipp or Fort of his
Majesties; upon penaltie to loose his flagg and to pay for the powder and
shott spend upon him. Yea, such is the respect to his Majesties Shippes in
all places of his Dominions, that no English ship displayeth the Flagge in
their presence, but runneth the like danger, except they be in his Majesties
service: and then they are in predicament of the Kings Ships.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>In Queene Maries Raigne, King Philip of Spaine comming to marry
with the Queene, and meeting with the Royall Navie of England, the Lord
William Howard, High Admirall of England, would not consent that the
King in the Narrow Seas should carrie his Flagge displayed until he came
into the Harbour of Plimouth.</p>

<p>I being of tender yeares, there came a Fleete of Spaniards of above
fiftie sayle of Shippes bound for Flaunders to fetch the Queene Dona
Anna de Austria, last wife to Philip the second of Spaine, which entered
betwixt the Iland and the Maine, without vayling their Top-sayles or
taking in of their Flags, which my father, Sir John Hawkins (Admirall of
a Fleete of her Majesties Shippes then ryding in Catt-water) perceiving,
commanded his Gunner to shoot at the flagge of the Admirall, that they
might thereby see their error.</p>
</div>

<p>The instances in which this point of view was impressed upon
foreign ships and English merchant ships are numerous.</p>

<p>The following example of the ceremonious manner in which the
salute was sometimes voluntarily rendered outside the "Narrow
Seas" is of special interest. It occurred during the expedition to
Algiers in 1620, under Sir Robert Mansell:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The one and thirtieth of October, in the morning wee turned into the
Road of Gibraltar, where were riding at anchor two of the King of Spaines<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
ships of warre, the Vice Admirall of a Squadron with the Kings Armes
in his fore-top and another, who so soone as they perceived us weighed
their Anchors, set sayle, and comming Lee-ward of our Admirall, strooke
his flag, saluting him with their small shot and great Ordnance, after haled
him with voyces; our Admirall striking his flag, answered them with voyces,
gave them his Ordnance and small shot, all the Fleet following in order.</p></div>

<p>Before the legislative union of the two kingdoms, the salute was
exacted by English men-of-war of ships of the Scottish navy. In
June, 1706, the 'Royal William,' one of the three small ships that then
comprised the Scots navy, put into Tynemouth, whereupon the
commanding officer of H.M.S. 'Dunwich' fired "a sharp great shot"
at her and complained that her commanding officer was displaying
a broad pendant in English waters. In his letter reporting the incident
to the Lord High Admiral of Scotland, Commodore Gordon adds
that the commander of H.M.S. 'Bonaventure' had told him "that
he should be sorry of meeting me without the Island of May, since
he had orders from the Board of England to make our frigates strike
and salute<a name="FNanchor_398" id="FNanchor_398"></a><a href="#Footnote_398" class="fnanchor">[398]</a>."</p>

<p>Closely connected in idea with the lowering of the flag in salute
and as a mark of respect to a stronger power is the lowering of it as
a sign of submission and surrender in action. Its application to this
purpose seems comparatively modern and to have been really an
extension of the salute. In naval warfare among the ancients and
during the middle ages submission was often of little use; the only
safe thing to be done by those who saw that they would be beaten
and cared to save their lives was to take to flight. Prisoners, except a
few likely to be of value for ransom, were usually disposed of summarily
by being thrown overboard, for there was little room for them
in the early ships and none at all in the galleys. It will be remembered
that Chaucer says of his "Schipman": "If that he foughte and hadde
the heigher hand By water he sente hem hoom to everyland." When
Hubert de Burgh's men in 1217 agreed that so soon as they had
boarded Eustace the Monk's ship one of their number should climb
the mast and cut down the flag, they did not imagine that this would
indicate surrender; the object they had in view was to confuse the
remaining enemy ships by depriving them of the mark by which they
could recognise their leader's ship.</p>

<p>Until the use of great ordnance had been sufficiently developed
at sea to enable an enemy ship to be overcome at a distance, it is
obvious that the dispute for the mastery could only be settled by
hand-to-hand encounter. In these circumstances there would be no
need of any method of indicating surrender other than by a personal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
appeal for quarter on the part of the vanquished crew, and indeed,
the vanquished would hardly have the time or opportunity of removing
the various flags placed along the bulwarks or flown from the masthead
as a preliminary to such an appeal. But when it became possible
for the ship to be destroyed from a distance, some method of indicating
a wish to surrender on terms became necessary. This appears
to have first been provided by displaying a flag of truce, a practice
that was no doubt adopted about the beginning of the sixteenth
century from the usages of land warfare where it had been current
for many centuries. The following instance of its employment at sea
occurred during Sir Richard Hawkins' voyage into the South Sea in
1593-4. In April, 1594, Hawkins' ship was caught at a disadvantage
in the Bay of San Mateo. The crew were not over-anxious to fight,
and talked of surrendering. Hawkins harangued them: "Came we
into the South Sea," he asked, "to put out flagges of truce? And left
we our pleasant England, with all her contentments with intention
and purpose to avayle ourselves of white ragges?" After some fighting,
which their neglect of proper preparations rendered useless, the captain
of the ship "presently caused a flagge of truce to be put in place of
our Ensigne, and began to parley of our surrendering<a name="FNanchor_399" id="FNanchor_399"></a><a href="#Footnote_399" class="fnanchor">[399]</a>." It will be
noted that the colours were hauled down and the white flag then
hoisted on the ensign staff.</p>

<p>This method of indicating a wish to surrender was evidently the
general practice at this period, for in the same year, during an attack
upon a carrack by the Earl of Cumberland at Terceira, some of the
crew of the carrack who had had enough fighting waved a flag of
truce and called out to the English to save their lives, but the captain
ordered them to take in the flag of truce, for he had determined never
to yield while he lived. In the time of the First Dutch War the striking
of the colours formed part of the outward symbolism of surrender,
but not the whole. According to Captain Joseph Cubitt's account of
the Battle off the Texel on 31st August, 1653, some of the Dutch ships
"that had lost all their masts struck their colours and put out a white
handkerchief on a staff, and hauled in all their guns<a name="FNanchor_400" id="FNanchor_400"></a><a href="#Footnote_400" class="fnanchor">[400]</a>." It may be
concluded from this that the mere hauling down of the colours was
not in itself considered sufficient to indicate that the ship desired to
take no further part in the fight, nevertheless it is clear that as great
importance was attached to the capture of the flags as to the capture
of a regiment's colours on land, for the States General published a
list of rewards<a name="FNanchor_401" id="FNanchor_401"></a><a href="#Footnote_401" class="fnanchor">[401]</a> offered to their "soldiers at sea" which included an
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>offer of 1000 guilders to him who should "fetch off and deliver up"
the flag of the chief admiral, 500 guilders for a subordinate admiral's
flag, 250 guilders for a jack, 150 guilders for a flag from the mizen,
and 50 guilders for a stern ensign.</p>

<p>The process of surrender is illustrated by Captain John Smith in
his <cite>Accidence for Young Seamen</cite><a name="FNanchor_402" id="FNanchor_402"></a><a href="#Footnote_402" class="fnanchor">[402]</a> in the following words:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>They hang out a flag of truce ... hale him amaine, abase or take in his
flag, strike their sailes and come aboard with their Captaine, Purser and
Gunner, with their commission, coket, or bils of lading.</p>
</div>

<p>By the time of the Second Dutch War (1666) the mediation of a
flag of truce appears to have become unnecessary, for Van de Velde's
picture of the surrender of the 'Royal Prince,' Admiral Ayscue's
flagship which ran aground on the Galloper during the Four Days'
Fight, clearly shows the lowered ensign and a man at the main masthead
in act of lowering the admiral's flag. Van de Velde was present
at the action, so that there can be little doubt but that the details are
correct. From this date the lowering of the colours appears to have
been sufficient.</p>

<p>But perhaps the principal reason for the disuse of the white flag
at sea lay in its ambiguity. On the occasion above referred to, Ayscue
was Admiral of the White Squadron, and the 'Royal Prince' was
displaying a large white flag at the masthead and an ensign which was
almost entirely white save for a small St George's cross in its upper
corner. In such circumstances the display of another white flag would
have been liable to misunderstanding. A like ambiguity would have
arisen in the French navy, where from 1661 until the Revolution
the ensign was plain white, and it may be noted that in 1794 during
the attack on Martinique the French fired on a flag of truce sent by
the English, and explained their action later as being due to a mistaken
supposition that it was intended for the colours of their late
rulers the Bourbons; whereupon it was agreed that in future ships
bearing flags of truce should have the enemy's flag at the bow and their
own national colours at the stern.</p>

<p>The plainest and most unmistakable method of indicating surrender
is to hoist the enemy colours above one's own, and this was
the course adopted by some of the Spanish ships which surrendered
at Trafalgar, although others appear to have hoisted the white flag
after hauling down their own colours<a name="FNanchor_403" id="FNanchor_403"></a><a href="#Footnote_403" class="fnanchor">[403]</a>. Modern practice, however,
recognises the hauling down of the colours accompanied by the cessation
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>of fire as sufficient; the victors on taking possession then hoist
their own flag above the enemy flag as a sign of capture.</p>

<p>It is evident from an incident that occurred during the capture of
the Island of Goree by Commodore Keppel in 1758 that the precise
significance of hauling down the flag was in doubt even at that comparatively
late date. The fire of the British Squadron was so overpowering
that the enemy's flag was hauled down and the fire thereupon
ceased.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>A lieutenant being ordered ashore, attended by the Commodore's
Secretary ... was surprised on being asked before they quitted the boat on
what terms the surrender was "expected." The lieutenant astonished at
this question asked if they had not struck their flag, intimating an unconditional
submission resting merely on the clemency of the victor? He
was answered "No: lowering of the flag was intended only as a signal for
a parley."</p>
</div>

<p>The action was thereupon renewed and finally the Governor
ordered the regimental colours to be dropped over the walls as a
signal of surrender at discretion<a name="FNanchor_404" id="FNanchor_404"></a><a href="#Footnote_404" class="fnanchor">[404]</a>.</p>

<p>The captor's flag is not hoisted above the colours of a neutral
vessel seized for breach of blockade or similar reasons; in such a case
the captor's flag (if hoisted) should be hoisted in another part of the
ship.</p>

<p>The custom of "half-masting" the flag, that is, of lowering it to
a position halfway or more down the flagstaff as a sign of mourning,
does not seem to be very ancient, but it is probably older than the
seventeenth century. The earliest instance in which I have met it
occurred in July, 1612, on the occasion of the murder of James Hall
by the Esquimoes during the first expedition in search of the North-West
Passage in which Baffin took part, when the 'Heart's Ease'
rejoined the 'Patience' with "her flag hanging down and her ancient
hanging over the poop, which was a sign of death." On entering the
Thames two months later the 'Heart's Ease' again lowered her flag
and ensign "in token and sign of the death of Mr Hall," so that it
was at that date well understood to signify the death of the commanding
officer of a ship. It was the custom in the navy after the
Restoration to observe the anniversary of the execution of Charles I
in a similar manner, for Teonge twice records the fact in his Diary:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>30 Jan. 1675. This day being the day of our King's marterdome wee
shew all the signs of morning as possible wee can, viz. our jacks and flaggs
only halfe staff high;</p>
</div>

<p class="no-indent">and again:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>30 Jan. 1678. A solemn day, and wee keep it accordingly with jacks
and pendents loared halfeway.</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span></p>
<p>Evidently the practice of half-masting the flags was well understood
both in the English navy and in the merchant service, but it
is doubtful if it became a universal custom until comparatively
modern times. The 'Black Pinnace,' which brought the body of
Sir Philip Sydney from Holland in 1586, had black sails, but the
illustration in the contemporary account of his funeral<a name="FNanchor_405" id="FNanchor_405"></a><a href="#Footnote_405" class="fnanchor">[405]</a> shows the
flags at the masthead, and the Danish ship which brought over the
Duke of Richmond's body in 1673 had a "black Flagg at his Main
Top Masthead and black colours<a name="FNanchor_406" id="FNanchor_406"></a><a href="#Footnote_406" class="fnanchor">[406]</a>." Black as a sign of mourning is
of great antiquity, and a black sail was used for this purpose among the
ancient Greeks, but a black flag was used by Drake at Cartagena in
1585 as a sign of war to the death, and was commonly adopted by
pirates with a like meaning. It was never used in the navy in the
sinister connection in which it is used ashore; an execution in one of
H.M. ships was signalised by the display of a yellow flag at the masthead.</p>

<p>We may conjecture that the original signification of the lowered
flag was the passing away of the authority which that flag connoted.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>After the battle of Lepanto in 1571 the fleet of Don John entered
Messina "the galleys gay with all their flags and streamers and towing
their prizes with lowered colours."</p>
</div>

<p>There were several ways of treating the flag of a captured ship
during the seventeenth century. It might be hung below the ensign
of the captor on his ensign staff, hung over his stern spread upon a
spar or trailing in the water, hung over the stern of the captured ship
in like manner<a name="FNanchor_407" id="FNanchor_407"></a><a href="#Footnote_407" class="fnanchor">[407]</a>, or kept to "dress ship" with. When Captain Heaton
was in command of H.M.S. 'Sapphire' during the First Dutch War,</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="no-indent">he took so many prizes that on a festival day the Yards, Stays, backstays
and shrouds being hung with Dutch, French, Spanish and Burgundian
colours and pendants variously intermixed, made a beautiful show, and
raised the courage of all belonged to her<a name="FNanchor_408" id="FNanchor_408"></a><a href="#Footnote_408" class="fnanchor">[408]</a>.</p>
</div>

<p>The practice of hoisting numerous flags in token of rejoicing is
so ancient and so widespread that it may be regarded rather as the
result of a primitive instinct than the outcome of any formal symbolism,
but it may be noted that, although the display of numerous flags
by ships in harbour on holy days and days of national rejoicing was
allowed, and in some cases even enjoined by authority, the display
at sea of "ostentatious bravery" was usually interpreted to indicate
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>some warlike or provocative action on the part of the ship indulging
in it. This was certainly the case until the end of the seventeenth
century, but with the dawn of the eighteenth a more law-abiding,
or perhaps we should say more civilised, spirit began to prevail upon
the sea, and these primitive methods of displaying the red rag to the
bull began to go into disuse. The practice of displaying flags upon
occasions of rejoicing, however, gave rise from time to time to unpleasant
incidents between ships of different nations from the indiscriminate
use of all the flags in a ship, including national flags of
other nations, in the desire to make a fair show; for until the nineteenth
century was well advanced both men-of-war and merchantmen
carried very few signal flags, which are the only flags over whose
relative precedence when hoisted in "dressing ship" no offence can
be given.</p>

<p>Prior to 1889 it was usual in the Royal navy for one of the junior
officers to draw up a scheme for "dressing ship" on ceremonial
occasions for the approval of the captain, but since that date the order
of the signal flags, some 60 in number, has been laid down in the
Signal Manual so that uniformity is secured, the national ensign (or
ensign of a foreign power if the occasion warrants the use of this)
being exhibited only at a masthead.</p>

<p>The modern practice, for all ordinary occasions, is to hoist the
national colours in the morning and to keep them up until sunset,
but innumerable references to hoisting or "heaving out" the colours
indicate that in earlier days this was not the custom, and that they
were only hoisted at sea when there was some special reason for so
doing. There was a routine for hoisting the flag in harbour in the
time of Elizabeth, for the orders for Drake's fleet in 1589 and the
"Brief Noates" of John Young <em>circa</em> 1596 both contain an article
to this effect, those absent without leave at the time being deprived
of their "aftermeal," but the hour at which the ceremony took place
is not stated. The practice at the end of the eighteenth century, as
related by Wm Spavens<a name="FNanchor_409" id="FNanchor_409"></a><a href="#Footnote_409" class="fnanchor">[409]</a>, Pensioner on the Naval Chest at Chatham,
was as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>At sunrise every ship in the fleet hoists her colours viz the ensign and
jack, unless it blows hard and the yards and top masts are struck, in which
case the colours are not hoisted but when some vessel is coming in or
passing; and at sunset they are again struck or hauled down; at half past
7 o'clock the drums begin to beat and continue till 8, when the ship on
board of which the Commander in Chief hoists his flag, fires a gun.</p>
</div>

<p>We do not know when this practice of hoisting the colours at
sunrise was first instituted, but it is not older than the seventeenth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
century. In 1844 the time was altered to 8 <span class="smcap">a.m.</span> from 25th March to
20th September and 9 <span class="smcap">a.m.</span> from 21st September to 24th March. If
there is sufficient light for the ensign to be seen, it is hoisted earlier
or later than these hours, if the ship is coming to an anchor, getting
under way, passing or meeting another ship, approaching a fort or
town, etc.</p>

<p>The use of false flags as a means to deceive or entrap an enemy
is probably as old as the flag itself. We have already had an example
of the application of a similar ruse in the case of the Greek and barbarian
standards in the year 480 <span class="smcap">b.c.</span>, but perhaps the earliest instance
upon record of the use of flags at sea for this purpose occurred about
the end of the twelfth century when Frederick of Sicily was a little
boy (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">dum ... Fredericus Sicilae Rex esset puerulus</i>). The Pisans had
fitted out twelve ships and galleys and set out to attack Messina, which
they tried to blockade. One night the citizens discovered that four
of the galleys were off the Pharos, or lighthouse. They fitted out
two galleys under Walter of Ferrara with picked crews, and hoisting
Pisan flags (which presumably would be visible near the lighthouse)
they fell upon the Pisans and took two of the galleys. Many instances
of the use of false flags, either to avoid scaring an unsuspecting prey
or to escape the notice of a stronger enemy, might be culled from the
sea literature of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, one of the
most interesting being the following, taken from Captain Wyatt's
account of Dudley's voyage in 1594-5:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>But this before mentioned Spaniarde perceavinge the imminent dainger
ensewinge and seinge noe way to avoyde it ... made triall of a thirde, which
was to worke theire safetie by desaitefull pollecie, a fitt subject for base
objects to worke strainge strategems, yett the usuall occupation of Spanish
practises. Being in this dilemma, and driven withall to this forced conclusion
by necessite, they bore up with us puttinge forth an English flagg, keeping

</div>

<p>Among more modern instances, one that is almost classic occurred
in January, 1797, when five large East Indiamen under the orders of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
Lennox, master of the 'Woodford,' met a French squadron of six
frigates off Java. Lennox immediately hoisted the flag of a British
admiral and made imaginary signals, and by this means deceived the
French into thinking that they were in presence of a number of
British men-of-war; with the result that they withdrew and the East
Indiamen escaped capture.</p>

<p>There is no clear pronouncement of International Law as to what
is and what is not lawful in the use of false colours, and publicists
are by no means unanimous upon the subject, but the following
instance is given by Halleck<a name="FNanchor_411" id="FNanchor_411"></a><a href="#Footnote_411" class="fnanchor">[411]</a> as an example of what should not be
allowable:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>In that year (1783) the 'Sybille,' a French frigate of thirty-eight guns,
Captain le Comte de Krergaron de Soemaria, enticed the British ship
'Hussar,' twenty guns, Captain J. M. Russell, by displaying an English
ensign reversed in the main shrouds, and English colours over French at
the ensign staff. She was also under jury-masts, had some shot holes, and
in every way intimated herself to be a distressed prize to some of the British
ships. Captain Russell at once approached to succour her, but she immediately,
by a preconcerted and rapid movement, aimed at carrying away
the bowsprit of the 'Hussar,' raking and then boarding her. This <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">ruse de
guerre</i>, of so black a tint, was only prevented taking full effect by the
promptitude of Captain Russell, who managed to turn his ship in such a
way as only to receive half the raking fire. He then engaged with the
'Sybille,' and, on eventually capturing her, publicly broke the sword of
the French captain, who he considered had sullied his reputation by
descending to fight the 'Hussar' for above thirty minutes under false
colours, and with signals of distress flying. "She" (the 'Hussar'), said
Captain Russell, "had not had fair play, but Almighty God had saved
her from the most foul snare of the most perfidious enemy." He confined
the captain of the 'Sybille' as a State prisoner. It appears that the latter
was subsequently brought to trial by his own Government, but was
acquitted.</p>
</div>

<p>It is, however, now generally agreed that ships of war may hoist
false colours for the purpose of deceiving the enemy, provided that
their proper national colours are substituted for them before any
hostile act is committed. As regards the use of neutral colours by
merchantmen seeking to escape capture, it will be remembered that
during the late war the Germans claimed this as a violation of the
law, but the British Government contended that it was a legitimate
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">ruse de guerre</i>, and had been recognised in the past as not entailing
a breach of international law.</p>

<p>A few remarks may be offered upon the various methods of fastening
the flag to its support. In the earliest times it seems to have been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
nailed to its staff, and while it was small and easily portable this
entailed no inconvenience. Afterwards it became customary to form
a socket of canvas, buckram, or other stout material to which the hoist
was sewn, and which was slipped over the staff from the top. This
method was only convenient for the smaller flags, and with larger
ones it appears to have been usual to sew a band of canvas down the
hoist and attach a number of <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;original text: robands">ribands</ins> to this by which the flag was
tied to the staff. Finally, the flag was sewn to a piece of rope which
could be made fast at the ends to halliards running through a block
or sheave in the cap at the top of the staff, but at first these halliards
were, in the case of masthead flags, taken only down to the top, not
to the deck, so that a sailor had to ascend the mast whenever the flag
was taken down or put up, or when any signal had to be made aloft.
Thus, during the battle with the Dutch off Lowestoft on 3rd June,
1665, the Duke of York</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="no-indent">ordered the signal to be given for the whole fleet to tack, but the sailor
who had got up the mast to give the signal was so long about it that before
he could let the flag fly Opdam had with his van bore up round.... This
little accident lost above six hours.</p></div>

<p>No doubt it was "accidents" of this nature that led, at a later
date, to the introduction of longer halliards reaching down to the
deck<a name="FNanchor_412" id="FNanchor_412"></a><a href="#Footnote_412" class="fnanchor">[412]</a>. After the introduction of the driver or spanker boom about
1790 the ensign staff on the poop had to be removed in three-masted
ships when the ship was under sail, and the ensign was then hoisted
at the "peak" or outer end of the gaff by which this spanker sail was
supported, the halliards passing from the poop through a small block
made fast at the extremity of this spar. This continued to be the
position for the ensign when the ship was at sea until the abolition of
sails brought it again to its original position.</p>

<p>It remains to say a few words about the sizes of flags. The "baucan"
streamer of <em>circa</em> 1293 was 30 yards long and 2 yards wide at
the head. In 1337 the streamers range from 14 to 32 yards in length
and were from 3 to 5 "cloths" wide. It is not known what the width
of a "cloth" was, but it was certainly not the full width in which the
cloth was made in the loom, which would have been 54 inches or
more. Probably it was about one yard, for the banners were 1¾ yards
long and 2 "cloths" wide, and we know that these were rectangular
and rather deeper in the hoist than they were long in the fly. In the
time of Elizabeth the streamers were from 12 to 28 yards long and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
2 to 3 yards broad at the head, rather less in size than those of 1337,
but the banners had increased in size and some were 5 yards long and
4½ yards deep. In 1623 ensigns were of 9 to 18 "breadths," flags 5 to
24 "breadths" and pendants 8 to 24 yards long. This "breadth"
was probably 11 inches, for in 1664 the material was being woven in
widths of 23 inches and then cut in half. Pepys, at a somewhat later
date, tells us that</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="no-indent">it is in general to be noted that the Bewper of which Colors are made
being 22 inches in breadth, and the half of that breadth or 11 inches going
in ordinary discourse by the name of a Breadth when wrought into Colours,
every such breadth is allowed about half-a-yard for its Fly.</p></div>

<p class="no-indent">By this rule the largest ensigns in 1623 were 27 feet long and 16 feet
6 inches deep, and the largest "flags" (i.e. masthead flags) 36 feet
long and 22 feet deep. In Pepys' time the ensign or flag of a first rate
was 26 breadths and 14 yards in the fly, while the jack was of 14
breadths and 7 yards fly, and the pendant 3 breadths at the head and
32 yards fly. The "distinction" pendant as used in the Downs was
broader and shorter, being of 5 breadths and 21 yards fly. The Lord
High Admiral's flag was 24 or 22 breadths and 12 or 11 yards fly.
In 1708 the ensigns had slightly increased in size and varied from
10 to 30 breadths, but the "breadth" was then nearer 10 inches than
11. An ensign of 26 breadths in 1709 was 14 yards long and the
Union canton was 189 inches by 117 inches. In 1742 ensigns were
from 16 to 34 breadths and 9 to 17 yards long, and jacks were from
6 to 16 breadths and 3 to 8 yards long.</p>

<p>These were truly enormous flags, and towards the end of the
eighteenth century the sizes seem to have suffered a gradual reduction.
In modern times the "breadth" has been reduced to 9 inches,
and the largest ensigns are not more than 22 breadths, but the relative
length of the flag has been slightly increased. Thus the largest ensign
of 1742 was 51 feet long and 28 feet deep; the largest modern ensign
is 33 feet long and 16½ feet deep. The largest Union flag is now
18 breadths, i.e. 27 feet by 13 feet 6 inches, while pendants vary
from 3 to 20 yards in length. The proportions of the crosses in a
modern Union flag are as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<table border="0" cellpadding="1" cellspacing="1" summary="Union Flag proportions">
<tr><td align="left">St George's Cross</td><td align="left">{ red</td><td align="left"><sup>1</sup>/<sub>5</sub> of width of flag</td></tr>
<tr><td align="left"></td><td align="left">{ white border</td><td align="left"><sup>1</sup>/<sub>15</sub> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; " &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "</td></tr>
<tr><td align="left">St Andrew's Cross</td><td align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;white</td><td align="left"><sup>1</sup>/<sub>10</sub> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; " &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "</td></tr>

<tr><td align="left"></td><td align="left"></td></tr>
</table></div>

<p>It may be observed that the white "fimbriation" of the St Patrick's
cross, required by the rules of heraldry to prevent the colour red
from touching the colour blue (white being a "metal": silver) is now<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
taken from the width of the red, reducing that from 1/10 to 1/15. The
two crosses, St Andrew's and St Patrick's ought, however, to be of
equal width, and the fimbriation of the latter should therefore be
taken from the blue ground.</p>

<p>In the white ensign the St George's cross in the fly is 2/15 of the
width of the flag. In the red and blue ensigns the Union canton now
occupies one-fourth of the flag; in the white it is, of course, slightly
smaller owing to the space occupied by the large St George's cross.</p>

<p>The pendant at the masthead of one of H.M. ships is a sign that
the ship is in "commission"; that is, in active service under the
command of an officer of the Royal Navy holding a commission from
the Crown or the Lord High Admiral or the Commissioners for
executing that office. It is not flown in ships in reserve. In ships
flying the flag of an Admiral, or a Commodore's broad pendant, the
Admiral's or Commodore's flag is in itself sufficient indication that
the ship is in commission, and the pendant is not flown in those
ships. It is, however, not struck when a captain hoists a Senior
Officer's pendant.</p>

<p>It is difficult to say when the custom of hoisting a pendant on
commissioning the ship became established. Mainwaring, writing
about 1623, speaks of the pendants as serving solely "for a show to
beautify the ship," and Boteler, ten years later, knew them only as
used for this purpose or as a means of distinguishing the squadrons
of a fleet<a name="FNanchor_413" id="FNanchor_413"></a><a href="#Footnote_413" class="fnanchor">[413]</a>; but from 1661 onwards there was, in addition to the three
squadronal pendants with red, white or blue fly, a fourth with the
fly striped red, white and blue. This was the distinctive pendant of
all H.M. ships in commission which did not form part of a fleet
divided into squadrons by the red, white and blue squadronal colours.</p>

<p>The first step towards the recognition of the pendant as the distinctive
sign of a man-of-war was taken by the Proclamation of 1661,
which assigned the Union pendant to H.M. ships only, and the next
by the Proclamation of 1674, which forbade merchantmen to fly
any pendant whatsoever; but although the use of a pendant was
thereby confined to men-of-war, it does not seem to have been the
custom at that time to fly it continuously. It is clear from the Diary
which Teonge, the naval chaplain, kept during his service in the
Navy from 1675 to 1679, that the pendant was only hoisted&mdash;with
the jack and ensign&mdash;when the ship wished to make her nationality
known; or was preparing to fight; or on days of rejoicing, when
pendants were hung from every yardarm; but the significance of the
pendant seems to have been generally recognised at that date, for in
the account which he gives of the launching in 1676 of a brigantine
by the Knights of Malta, he says that after the religious ceremony,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
"they hoysted a pendent to signify shee was a man of warre, and then
at once thrust her into the water."</p>

<p>Although it was not until 1824 that the King's Regulations for the
Navy contained any instruction that ships in commission were to
fly a pendant, it is probable that the practice of flying a pendant
continuously in H.M. ships in commission was established about the
end of the seventeenth century, for the first edition of the Regulations
(1731) contained a direction to Captains "to husband the Ship's
Colours, and not to keep them abroad in windy weather, the Pendant
being a sufficient mark of distinction," from which it is clear that
the latter was then flown continuously. The practice in the Navy at
the beginning of the nineteenth century is given by Captain Basil
Hall<a name="FNanchor_414" id="FNanchor_414"></a><a href="#Footnote_414" class="fnanchor">[414]</a> in the following words:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>In the mean time I must proceed to put my ship in commission. The
first thing to do is to get hold of one of the warrant-officers to "hoist the
pendant," which is a long slender streamer, having a St George's cross
on a white field in the upper part next the mast, with a fly, or tail, either
Red, White, and Blue, or entirely of the colour of the particular ensign
worn by the ship; which, again, is determined by the colour of the Admiral's
flag under whose orders she is placed. The pendant being hoisted shows
that the ship is in commission, and this part of the colours is never hauled
down day or night. At sunset, when the ensign is hauled down, a smaller
pendant three or four yards in length, is substituted for the long one,
which, in dandified ships, waves far over the stern. Ships in ordinary<a name="FNanchor_415" id="FNanchor_415"></a><a href="#Footnote_415" class="fnanchor">[415]</a>
hoist merely an ensign.</p>
</div>

<p>According to modern practice the pendant is hoisted at 9 a.m.
on the day on which the ship is "commissioned" and is kept flying
night and day (unless an Admiral's flag is hoisted in her) until she
is "paid off." At the present day the regulation size is strictly adhered
to, even in "dandified ships"; but it is a common practice for ships
abroad, when ordered to return home to pay off, to hoist a very long
narrow pendant, apparently as a sign of rejoicing. This pendant,
which is of course not officially recognised, is made by the signal
staff out of white bunting which they have "acquired" in the course
of the commission, and is usually of such length (150-250 feet) as
to reach from the masthead to the water, even when inclined at a
considerable angle from the perpendicular, but in some instances it
is much longer and it has been known to reach 1400 feet. A bladder
filled with air is fastened at the end to keep it buoyant when trailing
on the water.</p>

<p>It was at one time the custom to fly the Union flag at the masthead
of any of H.M. ships in which a foreign personage of importance
was embarked. The two following examples are typical of this usage,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>which is now obsolete. When William Prince of Orange came to
England in 1677 to marry the Princess Mary, the royal yacht which
brought him over carried this flag at the masthead while he was on
board; and in 1689 Admiral Russell, who had embarked the Queen
of Spain in his ship at Flushing and conveyed her to the Downs and
thence to Corunna, flew the Union flag at the main topmast-head
during the time the Queen was on board his ship. In modern times
the personal standard of the Prince or the Queen would have been
flown, but it is clear from these and similar examples that the wearing
of a foreign flag at the masthead of one of H.M. ships would at an
earlier period have been regarded as an intolerable act of humiliation.</p>

<p>Analogous to this usage was the flying of the Union flag at the main
when the Lord Lieutenant of Ireland, Governors of Colonies, or
Ambassadors were embarked, but this mark of honour was not permitted
in the waters of the English Channel or in the presence of an
Admiral's flag. In 1821 the Lord Lieutenant of Ireland was granted
the use of a special form of the Union flag bearing in the centre
a harp on a blue escutcheon, and in modern times the Governors
General or Governors of Colonies or Dominions may, when afloat, fly
a Union flag bearing the badge of the Colony in the centre.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>In this account of the history of British flags I have not dwelt
upon the immaterial or emotional aspects of these important national
emblems; partly because this seemed somewhat foreign to the aim
I had in view; partly because this side has been sufficiently illustrated
in other works. There is, however, one aspect which may receive
an illustration here. Among the privileges and duties of which a
British flag has for so many centuries been an outward emblem, not
the least in value has been that of freedom. Towards the end of 1769
Lord St Vincent, then plain Captain Jervis, was in the Port of Genoa
in H.M.S. 'Alarm.' Two Turkish galley slaves temporarily released
from their chains were walking on the mole near their galley when
they caught sight of one of the 'Alarm's' boats. They jumped into
her and wrapped themselves in the British colours, claiming their
freedom. The Genoese guard removed them by force, part of the
boat's pendant being torn away in the struggle. Jervis demanded of
the Doge and Senate of Genoa that the officer of the guard should
bring the slaves with the fragment of the colours and make a formal
apology on the quarter deck of the 'Alarm.' When this had been done,
Jervis "asked the slave who had wrapped the pendent round his
body what were his sensations when the guard tore him from the
pendent staff. His reply was that he felt no dread for he knew that
the touch of the royal colours gave him freedom." And upon this
note I must make an end.</p>
